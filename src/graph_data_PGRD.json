Why was the Republican political system, which had delivered such stunning successes abroad, torn apart from within? \u00a0And how did Augustus manage to secure and consolidate power, in spite of the traditional Roman distrust of autocracy? \u00a0In this course, we shall attempt to answer these questions. \u00a0In doing so, special attention will be given to various key aspects of the social history of the Roman World, and their interaction with political and military events.",

Each of the disciplines shares a core concern with cultural identity, difference and change across time and space, in both material and nonmaterial worlds. They deploy a wide range of theoretical frameworks and methodologies (fieldwork, lab work, data analysis) that in many ways bridge the divide between the humanities, the social sciences and the physical sciences. In introducing students to ways in which the three disciplines approach Nature and Culture, the course will build on the two overarching themes of Body and Environment. Within these, students will investigate key topics and case studies around bipedality, foodways, totemism, migration, archaeological tourism and more. Although materials and methods differ between disciplines, the challenge of the Anthropocene makes it more critical than ever to understand the past, present and future of our societies, and what it is that makes us human. This course provides a unique cross disciplinary perspective on these vital questions.",

Beginning with some of the things that are closest and most familiar to us - including the clothes on our backs - we're going to start at the ground and trace upwards the links that attach us to far off countries, economies, sites of production and\u00a0fellow humans. In this way, we will trace our own map of the world system and get some sort of critical understanding of how we slot into it. In the process, we will ask 'Is there a more ethical way for us to approach some of those core global practices in which we all participate: consumption, tourism, inhabiting the city, and using the internet and social media?' How, in this immensely complex context, are we to be good global citizens?\nIn the process of doing this we will learn the fundamental concepts anthropologists and other social scientists use to make sense of globalisation's exciting new cultural and social forms and its not so exciting new forms of exploitation and inequality. The focus will be on understanding the language of the anthropology of globalisation, and the practical and critical application of its key concepts to real life global issues. ",

Topics explored include: the saliency of the categories man and woman; the relationships between race and gender; the role of colonialism and neocolonialism in the representation of gender, sex and sexuality; the usefulness of the notion of oppression; the relationship between cultural conceptions of personhood and cultural conceptions of gender; and the ethnocentricity of the concepts of gender, sex and sexuality themselves.

When considering humans alone, the course will examine the effect of environmental disasters cross-culturally by comparing victimology along with how different populations have prepared for, responded to and recovered from past disasters. The course will then expand on this through cross-species comparisons with the way other primates respond to and recover from the same (or similar) disasters.\u00a0 This course will also consider the role of disaster relief agencies in different cultural contexts and will use information learned from historical disasters to discuss what the expected impact of current environmental disasters may be.",

These are two different but related aspects of our approach to `states\u2019 in this course: conceptual and ethnographic, both necessary and important to relate to each other. We will examine concepts, and look at examples of practices and processes in a number of significant domains, in order to comprehend states, in their variety, in a distinctively anthropological manner. Most of our central readings are by anthropologists, and involve the relating to each other of concepts and ethnography. Central topics through which we will look at this conjunction will include everyday practices; culture and state ritual; law and regulation; personhood and agency; hidden and overt mechanisms of power; persistent structures, emergent and mixed (state-private and other) forms of governance. Along the way we look at examples of some of the rubrics currently most often applied to states: the `stable\u2019 state; the `would-be\u2019 state (`Islamic state\u2019?), the `failed\u2019 state. Ethnographically, we will especially (but not exclusively) focus on what are considered developing states, by which is meant here: those which offer fewer entitlements and have penetrated less completely into the daily lives of their citizens, than is customary in the state systems of better-off countries. Thus the course is for students of the social sciences and related areas of practice such as development studies and social research.",

Crossing Borders covers the core theories and key case studies students will need to make sense of the complex terrain of contemporary international and domestic migration, both voluntary and forced. Beginning with a focus on international migration from developing to developed nations, we ask:*Why do people migrate?*Why do they go where they do?*What are their experiences of resettlement, work and community in their new host nations?*How do migrant communities form distinctive identities as a result of their migration experiences?*How do host nations react to flows of legal and informal migrants in terms of policy and in terms of ideologically driven responses?*How do host nation policies and social ideologies, especially around race, shape processes of migrant and refugee identity formation?*What relationships do contemporary international migrants maintain with their homelands?We then move to a focus on labour migration, both international and domestic, in developing nation contexts. Here we take a special focus on feminised labour migration for factory and domestic work in Asia and the Middle East. In this context, we enquire:*What experiences of marginalisation and exploitation do female labour migrants experience in host nations and cities?*How do they negotiate and resist harsh labour regimes and gendered and racist stereotyping?*What kinds of long-distance family relationships come into existence as a result of the migration of these women?*How do 'cash, communications and care' circulate in transnational families?*What development effects might the economic and social remittances sent by labour migrants back to home communities have?In terms of teaching approach, the course emphasis will be on understanding and mastering the language and theoretical tools used in the anthropology of migration, and the practical and critical application of\u00a0 key course concepts to real life migration experiences. We will use an innovative team based learning approach in which students help each other workshop the weekly readings and carry out critical and interpretive activities in class based on empirical case studies of migration.",

Considering violence from an anthropological perspective foregrounds concerns of meaning, representation and symbolism\u2014understanding violence as expression as much as instrument. We will be approaching violence as usually meaningful and always culturally mediated, a phenomenon that is not outside the realm of human society.\nA key theme to be explored is the contention that violence, rather than necessarily signifying a breakdown in social existence, often plays a part\u2014perhaps even a fundamental one\u2014in the maintenance or creation of particular forms of social order. To this end, we will be concerned with analysing not only the explicit acts of bodily harm that occur in violent conflict but more subtle forms of violence perpetrated by the nation\u2013state and global institutions. In this sense, a vital aspect of the course involves engaging with the \u2018anthropology of state practices\u2019 through considering the relation of state and society as this shapes occurrences and expressions of violence.\nFinally, we consider the relation of anthropology and anthropologists to debates about universal human rights and reflect on the position of the anthropologist in witnessing, theorising and writing about violence, as well as the methodological challenges, ethical dilemmas, dangers and responsibilities involved.",

This course is designed taking into account (a)\u00a0students' own participation and contribution to curriculum design, (b) diverse students' interests straddling academic and applied, policy-orientated analysis and, (c) students freedom (and responsibility) to develop an independent research project that can either take the form of an academic research paper or a policy position paper. The course is structured in three main parts. Part I (week 1-4) serves as a primer for key theoretical debates within the discipline. This equips students with the necessary tools to to critically analyse key concepts in development . Part II ( week 5 onwards) covers several key concepts in the anthropology of development. Students are given the opportunity to vote for which topics to cover in class. This presents students with an opportunity to take ownership of the curriculum and select key concepts students deem central to grasp contemporary and emerging development aid processes. Part III endows students the opportunity to develop an independent research project in relation to one key concept. Two scaffolding workshops are provided throughout the semester in order to assist students with developing their research project.",

This course focuses especially on the Gathering Data phase. We will explore, and pay critical attention to, certain 'rapid assessment' methods and tools that have become standard in many kinds of development work in the last two to three decades. These tools are used to map or document the varied relationships between members of local communities and their environmental, social and cultural resources. We will explore the concept of 'participation' that underlies those tools. We will consider differences and similarities between these participatory development tools and standard anthropological methods. Throughout, we will keep in mind questions of research ethics, kinds of knowledge and observation, and the politics, conflicts and dynamics of research with and within local communities.",

This method brings with it both advantages and challenges. It allows anthropologists (and, by extension, their readers, project teams, and employers) to look into human motivations, concerns, hopes, and joys \u2013 in short, to see the fine detail of life behind the numbers of government reports, economic trends, opinion polls, and other statistics. At the same time, there is an intimate relationship between researcher and researched (individuals called informants, collaborators, partners, and often friends) that does not always exist in other fields. This course will chart the emergence of anthropology as a fieldwork science, and the changing features of ethnographic practice over 100 years of disciplinary history. We then engage with emerging trends and theories related to new fieldwork contexts like corporate and design applications, and digital anthropology.\nOver the course of the semester we will survey and apply a broad range of anthropological methods. This course is structured as a practicum, emphasizing learning by doing. Each student will develop one project for the whole semester. Practicums will involve trialling, sharing, debating, and brainstorming applied anthropology in real world contexts.",

Organisations like the World Bank have the potential to set the agenda for international development assistance, and traditionally have done so. However, geo-political changes at the start of the \u201cAsian Century\u201d are now leading to new and competing sources of development knowledge and finance. In this context, we explore the ideas, tools and policies that are typically used by Multilateral Development Banks to guide their operations and exert influence, including: the Sustainable Development Goals; loans for infrastructure; country-level reform packages; mechanisms for securing global public goods like biodiversity; rising private sector engagements; safeguards and grievance mechanisms; and indicators. We explore the power, efficacy and limitations of these global governance practices, revealing: (i) the social construction and political nature of global expertise; and (ii) how institutions like the World Bank are not monolithic, but are often subject to internal contestation and practical limitations, as they confront a wide variety of complex, real-world problems.\nThis course material has proven to be appropriate for EMD and MAAPD Masters students, as well as others in POGO, International Relations and Anthropology.",

Likewise, insular Southeast Asia will be considered solely through the Austronesian migrations from which originated the prehistoric Pacific cultures. We will tackle a wide range of anthropological questions with a holistic approach, using concepts from archaeology, linguistics, comparative ethnography, physical anthropology and biology. A significant portion of the course will be dedicated to the examination of the timing and process of prehistoric colonization in Oceanic islands and archipelagoes, using examplesfrom the Lapita culture in the West Pacific as well as Polynesian cultures in the East. Regional chronocultural sequences will also be analyzed in detail. Finally, we will round out the course by addressing a variety of themes including the evolution of socio-political complexity, religious architecture, funerary practices, settlement patterns, subsistence practices, human-ecosystem interactions within island environments, and material culture and technology. Special topics including traditional oceanic navigation will also be presented throughout the semester. Topics discussed through presentations in tutorials will complete the lectureprogram.",

Much of what we know of the deeper past comes from natural archives of changing cultural landscapes and environment. In Australia and the Asia-Pacific region there is a rich body of evidence for past changes in culture, climate, landscape and biodiversity that is only just beginning to be explored. The evidence for critical transitions that have occurred in nature and society will be discussed and students will see first-hand examples of how environmental change has influenced past and present societies and cultures. The course combines in-class learning, museum visits and fieldtrips to Mt Fuji and the ANU's coastal campus (Kioloa Coastal Campus).

Domestication is ordinarily considered a Holocene phenomenon, largely restricted to the last c. 11,700 years. However, the human management of animal and plant species, as well as anthropic alteration of habitats, has a much greater time depth. Domestication is usually associated with food production, especially different forms of agriculture. Domesticates facilitated the expansion and intensification of cultivation and animal husbandry through time, thereby enabling the rapid growth of many human societies. Not all human societies domesticated species, and not all species were domesticated for food, plausibly including the earliest animal and plant domesticates.\n\nIn this course, we will address a series of questions including:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How do we define domestication?\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What are the phenotypic and genotypic attributes of domestication and how do these vary between species/groups of species?\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How do we use archaeobotanical, zooarchaeological and ancient DNA evidence to determine when a species was domesticated in the past?\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How did people domesticate animals and plants in the past, where did this occur, and how long did the process take?\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can we identify domestication syndromes and domestication pathways for groups of plants and animals?\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What were the historical implications of domestication for the societies involved?\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How have domesticatory processes continued to the present-day?",

These assemblages provide us clues to interpret human behaviour and anthropogenic impact in the environment, as well as insights on how climate change has affected human populations from the Quaternary until the present.\nArchaeology offers unique long-term and culturally-specific perspectives on human\u2013climate interaction. Our discipline provides baselines for evaluating contemporary climate issues such as sea level rise, island abandonment, biogeographic shifts and habitat change or debating the reintroduction of lost species.This course examines human\u2013climate interaction in the archaeological record from 0.5 million years ago, through the development of modern humans and the last glacial maximum (LGM), into the historic present.We will learn how to use appropriate methods to investigate climate change in the past. Through the introduction of case studies, we will address the methodologies applied and the problematics documented in environmental archaeology analyses. We will conduct practical analyses on soil, archaeobotanical and osteoarchaeological samples in seminars and tutorials.",

The content is variable - offering a variety of core areas of research expertise in Archaeological and Evolutionary Science, always taught over one academic session. The course has a standard generic structure, but with varied topic content, like a reading course or sub-thesis.\nStudents commence the course with 4-5 weeks of independent reading and research as preparation. The student then attends a 5 day intensive course normally on campus at the ANU, at the ANU Kioloa Field station, at NARU or at another laboratory or residential field location. This intensive five day program is followed up with work on tasks and course assessments with on-line supervision at low intensity, for delivery and completion by the end of the session/semester.\nNormally each year, this course will deliver a minimum of three Masterclass courses. The content and topics will vary from course to course. At least ONE Masterclass will be offered per year with the option of up to four Masterclasses per annum with one in each of the Summer, Autumn, Winter and Spring Sessions, dependent on student demand and availability of faculty and/or visitors.",

Topics of inquiry include: anatomical illustration; obstetric imagery; war and disability; arts activism; medicine in contemporary art; and the medical 'gaze.' Different kinds of images and objects are dealt with in each class, from illustrations of dissections through to oil paintings of celebrity physicians, photographs of \u2018hysterics\u2019 to patient self-portraits. We take an object-based approach, with students being encouraged to find images and objects of interest to them for focused examination. Together we endeavour to develop new methodologies for thinking critically and writing sensitively about images and objects that sit at the intersection of the history of art and the history of medicine, disability studies and gender studies.",

It is aimed at students engaged in either practice-led research or art history and theoretical research in the creative arts. It introduces a variety of strategies and models for experimenting with voice, structure and content and addresses writing for different contexts - academic, art museums and the visual and creative industries more generally. The aim throughout is to develop students' critical awareness of various ways of writing and skills and confidence for writing at an advanced level.\n\nStudents will conduct self-directed research in order to create a conceptual framework that incorporates their creative practice, methodologies and outcomes. Employing rigorous research that underpins the broader context of the student\u2019s Higher Degree Research project, they will demonstrate a high level of critical awareness and evaluation of their writing processes.\n\nStudents are encouraged to contact the course convenor to discuss their choice of subject.",

Relevant to students with any level of experience and from all visual arts and design disciplines, this course introduces a range of skills and concepts to support future specialised practice-led research. Each week students are presented with different tasks and approaches to seeing and drawing the human body by identifying space, shape, form, line, gesture, expression, movement, colour, tone and composition. The experience of drawing is broadened by testing a variety of drawing mediums and techniques through haptic exploration. In class students build up a substantial portfolio of work and gain confidence through independent drawing practice. A deeper knowledge of drawing in context of historical and contemporary art and design practices is furthered through weekly tutorial slide presentations and critical reflections. This course supports postgraduate coursework students who wish to advance their skills in drawing and further develop visual literacy and haptic knowledge in order to undertake future independent practice-led research.

At the same time, artists are working with photography in new ways: large-scale photographic prints and installations and public interventions have replaced the small, enframed prints which populated Gallery walls only a few decades ago. This course will explore a range of methodological, political and aesthetic issues arising from these shifts in image culture. Through a series of practical projects, students will work the dynamics of visibility and size in photography from the pixel to the gigapixel, and the logistics of exhibiting large scale photographic works - from the print to screen.

This kind of art practice sets up a constructed situation as a framework in which participants have, or are intended to have, agency in the production of the work. The experimental nature of the construction of situations does not determine what the artwork is in advance of its audience. It is constituted by the dialogue or interaction that the situation elicits. The course will centre on student-led projects developed within specific contexts, which will require context-specific research and knowledge acquisition. These projects will not necessarily be undertaken individually, and the way in which students become involved in each other's projects will be an important exercise in negotiating different roles. Social practice is also becoming an important form of outreach for museums and so the projects will address the future implications of this as well as situating their methods in relation to the history of dialogue and participation in art practice.",

This involves finding ways to respond to how spaces are used and formed by humans and non-humans, their ecologies, atmospheres, architecture, histories, relational dynamics and functions. Spatial practice involves taking action, and sometimes making actions that are already taking place visible. It often involves both conceptual and intuitive approaches, using media that are most conducive to the project. Site responsive projects are ubiquitous in biennials and other contemporary art exhibitions around the world, and in developing their own projects, students will examine the genealogy of art practice that current approaches have developed from and consider new directions.",

Understanding the artist's role as one actor among others in the creation of a work, in this course we will explore how to bring the relations between different actors to the fore. The course will involve analysis of recent posthuman art projects and the development of projects that explore specific systems and relations, activating different media and materials.

The way contemporary artists engage in history making is to question given formats and representational conventions, exposing their latent power and reworking them. The production of histories is intimately entwined with the generation of possible futures and this course explores the political responsibility of artistic-historical narratives and their agency in transmitting and shaping the digestion of the stories they tell. Each student will undertake research into a specific (probably local) history, using methods from relevant disciplines, which could include ethnographic methods like participant observation or historiographic methods like oral history, archival and textual research, but could also include archaeological methods like surveying and excavating. Students will research the methods and media that are most appropriate to the history they are working on, and then educate themselves on how to go about using these methods and media within their capabilities and the resources available to them. The conceptual design and the realization of each of the students' projects will be informed by analysis of a various contemporary art projects which engage in the politics of memory and their approach to formats like the visual essay, the voice-over, re-enactment, the edited interview, archival display, and the monument. Although the media students work with is dependent on the conceptual development of their projects, the course will include some technical instruction on video production, post-production and installation.",

Automation is also a delegation to an external process, a way of \"letting the world in,\" as Robert Morris wrote. But automation is accompanied by accidents and this course will review the history of the accident from ancient Greece into the present. By intervening in social, environmental and technological systems, probing contemporary forms of automation and accident, we will develop a deeper understanding of what autonomy means for artists now and how to engage systems without being instrumentalised by them.",

Using primary sources, literary works, documentary, and film, we will explore such topics as: the genealogy of modern Korean nationalism through peasant and aristocratic rebellions in the 19th century; the tangled relationship between Korea and Japan during the period of Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945); how North Korea became communist and specifically women in the creation of North Korea; the scars of the Korean War (1950-53); counter-cultural movements in 1970s and 80s South Korea; and contemporary challenges facing South and North Korea. This course will give students a thorough grounding in Korean history, and introduce them to major interpretative currents in the study of Korean history.",

The course will focus closely on the approaches historians have employed in studying Japan\u2019s modern history. \u00a0In other words, what social and political theories have historians deployed and why? How have these approaches changed and/or enriched our understanding of modern Japan? The course will pay close attention to some of the ongoing controversies and debates in the historiography of modern Japan. \u00a0Students will be expected to think critically about both the history of Japan and the approaches historians have adopted.\u00a0",

Understanding how a map was produced, who, why, and what for, can provide a remarkable insight into how a group of people view themselves, their connections to other people, and what they consider important. Being able to interpret, use, and even create your own map are key skills for us to understand these factors, successfully use a map for our own goals, and to communicate such information to others. This course will consider maps and mapping both as a subject to investigate and as a concise means of presenting research results. Focusing on the region of Asia and the Pacific, we will critically explore the history of maps, how different cultures utilise and present maps differently, and what these maps can tell us about how different people viewed the region at different times. This exploration will provide students with experience accessing the wealth of resources available for using and researching modern and historical maps of Asia and the Pacific. We will also explore the techniques and tools needed to make your own maps.",

In the middle of the 20th century, in the aftermath of the Second World War, policy-makers became aware that the terms of peace could have a powerful impact on the likelihood of return to conflict. Significant progress has been made in developing peace-making processes that undercut the original causes of conflict and which thus diminish the possibility that conflict will recur. Architectures of international cooperation and inter-dependence also work to diminish the possibility of war.\u00a0\nThe historical memory of conflict, however, has proven to be a serious and intractable obstacle to international harmony. The historical bitterness that afflicts Japan\u2019s relations with Korea and China is greater now than at any time since the Second World War. Ancient antagonisms pit Cambodia against its two neighbours, Thailand and Vietnam. The memory of the massacre of communists in Indonesia 50 years ago looms as an issue in contemporary Indonesian politics.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, formal and informal reconciliation process in various countries of the region (including Korea, Cambodia and East Timor) have shed light on possible paths to preventing the legacies of bitter histories from causing ongoing conflict.\nThis course will critically analyse the processes used in dealing with the past, as well as the prospects and challenges for cooperation and reconciliation.\u00a0",

Even after the collapse of the major historic imperial powers during the second half of the twentieth century, the legacies of those empires continue to shape contemporary life. And historians and political analysts still talk in terms of - and seek to redefine - imperialism in reference to present polities.\n\u00a0\nChina is central to such discourses on imperial power: it offers a particularly rich body of historical evidence for the practice of empire. This introductory course will therefore assess that evidence and survey the great drama of Chinese attempts to bring under single control and preserve the unity of its vast territories, so varied ethnically, culturally, and geographically. It will take in the full sweep of China\u2019s imperial past: it will start in the third century BC, when the foundations of the imperial system were consolidated; it will reach into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when encounters with Western powers forced a radical reappraisal of the Chinese imperial system. Dividing this broad chronological scope into three periods - early China, medieval China, and late imperial China - it will offer a sense of larger changes and continuities over time. Within each period, it will bring into sharp focus the social, cultural, and political arenas in which Chinese empire was developed and maintained.",

It provides the necessary background knowledge to understand the later processes of colonisation and state formation in South Asia within its Asian context and introduces changing conceptions of the past of South Asia through examining the current major scholarly debates on issues in pre-colonial South Asian history.",

It will focus on the crucial question: what is South Asia? In the multiplicity of dynamic and often ephemeral answers, the course will offer glimpses of the many Indias, Pakistans, Sri Lankas, and so on that reside in peoples imaginations.\n\nIt will begin during a critical period of the British Raj and survey the complex processes, events and ideologies that went into the shaping of the nations and regions of South Asia. It will follow the progression of colonialism and the emergence of anticolonial and national movements as well as struggles that slipped under the radar of popular national movements. The course will explore the violent moments of Independence and the contending aspirations of the newly minted nation-states.\n\nApart from opening up the world of South Asia to students, this course will also foray into questions of what it means to study Asia in the contemporary world.

The variation in these trajectories\u2014in their cultural origins and in their content\u2014can make their crossings unpredictable and explosive and often unintelligible. This course will explore with students the claims and negotiations that are fundamental to some of the critical debates in Indian history and politics over the past two centuries. In particular it will aim to alert students to the possibility that underlying these contentious events, ideas and processes are contending claims to truth and authenticity.\nThe course will focus on a set of truth claims that constitute the interface of cultural interactions within India and between Indian cultures and the rest of the world: stereotypes, stories, histories, myths, corruption and claims to authenticity and ethnicity. Such a study of India, by facilitating the study of cultural interactions through the prism of different configurations of truth and falsity, rather than the prism of power, will also encourage students to think more broadly and deeply about the interplay between notions of truth.",

Asia and the Pacific form the linguistically most diverse area in the world, and past and present societies across the two regions are typically identified by the kind of languages they speak. The course explores the status and internal diversity of a number of different language groupings, including language families such as Sino-Tibetan, Austroasiatic, Tai-Kadai and Austronesian, linguistic areas such as India and Mainland Southeast Asia, and languages whose historical connections remain debated, such as Japanese and Korean, and it considers what language histories can tell us about the non-linguistic histories of Asia-Pacific societies. The course aims to introduce students to the basic principles and methods of historical linguistics, including processes of language change and language contact, as well as the ways in which linguistic development reflects socio-cultural change. We will use language history as a starting point for broader discussions that incorporate research from anthropology, archaeology and population genetics, asking how the different disciplines tell similar or different stories about the Asia-Pacific past.",

It is also currently in the midst of major transformations. Developments in the region, including the rise of China and ongoing efforts to resolve the crisis created by the last remaining corner of the Cold War \u2013 the division of the Korean Peninsula \u2013 have global implications. Meanwhile, the countries of the region are gradually moving towards the creation of closer regional integration. In order to understand these developments, and their profound implications for Australia and the rest of the world, we need to understand the historical, cultural and social context in which they occur. This course offers a new look at Northeast Asia. Key themes addressed include: the legacies of the Asia-Pacific and Korean Wars; the Cold War architecture of Northeast Asia; migration and cultural interactions between the countries of the regions in the Cold War and post-Cold War eras; the Korean Peninsula and Taiwan questions and their implications for relations between the countries of the region; and contemporary political and social issues in the region. This course will help students to further develop their research skills, through finding and interpreting archival resources, current data and visual material on Northeast Asia.\u00a0",

Experimenting with forms that may include ethnography, life writing, embodied practice, fiction, visual art, and/or multimedia, we will consider how different ways of representing place, person, voice, the self, history, and the integration of creative practice and critical theory can lead to new and expanded ways of engaging with Asian and Pacific societies.",

More recent events need to be understood in the context of the region's long history of cataclysmic disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, volcanic eruptions, flood and drought, and a sequence of devastating epidemics, from the Plague through to avian flu. This course addresses the social, cultural and economic dimensions of the history of disasters and epidemics in Asia and the Pacific, the role of these events in shaping societies in the region, and the recent transformations in the scale of their impacts and the nature of trans-national, state and community responses. Case studies of particular disasters and epidemics address questions of their causes and consequences, and will be grounded through guest lectures in an understanding of the science of disasters. The scope for reducing future impacts is considered within the framework of both state and community-based strategies for the promotion of resilience and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), the unequal distribution of risk, risk assessment and insurance, and the additional contribution of global climate change.",

Through a series of case studies of the region, students will develop the skills to analyse how the norms, practices and structures that underpin international affairs today have developed since the 19th century, and what role Asia and the Pacific region played in this process. The course prompts students to imagine alternative pathways and outcomes arising from specific historical moments. Examples of these key case studies include: Pattern of the adaptation of international law by China and Japan; alternatives to the Europe-centred world system; critical assessment of the idea of human rights; colonial participation in international organisations; the development of international anti-terrorist law; historical origins of the border disputes in Northeast Asia; and the development of refugee law, with its implications for the current refugee crisis in Asia and Australia.\n\u00a0",

Such challenges and conflicts emerge out of historical, social, economic, political, religious and cultural movements and debates, often linked to wider global forces. Topics include: the impact of colonialism, the politics of gender, nationalism and the environment, the postcolonial state and its role in conflict and environmental degradation. We also explore how indigenous knowledge and cultural traditions have been enrolled in the service of an ecological ethic and the kind of ideologies and activities have inspired environmental activism.\u00a0\nMore generally, the course considers the critical question of how Asian and Pacific societies have redefined their relationship to the environment from the colonial period until\u00a0the\u00a0present day.

Language, and different patterns of multilingualism, reflect and create social and cultural identities, and are intertwined with the social and political hierarchies that influence conflict and conflict resolution, equality and inequality, and processes of social stability and change. The language diversity of Asia and the Pacific is also influential on a global scale. The region is the source of some of the world\u2019s most widely used languages, as well as leading the global diversification of English.

The strengths and weaknesses of these frameworks\u2014which include human behavioural ecology, evolutionary psychology, and various cultural evolutionary approaches\u2014are addressed in a critical manner with the aim of establishing an integrated approach that borrows the best from each. A wide range of case studies will be used to illustrate the application of these principles. Topics include conflict and cooperation, foraging and resource use, mating and parenting, life history and fertility, and the individual in society. Some attention will be paid to the history of the evolutionary study of human behaviour, including the nature-nurture debate and the \u201csociobiology controversy.\u201d",

Lectures cover a variety of topics including: morphology and distinguishing characteristics of each group of living primates; social organisation, mating, activity and diet as well as community ecology. Once lectures are complete, tutorial work will be done through the collection of behavioural data on primate groups at the National Zoo and Aquarium (NZA). Students will be trained in data collection and assigned a species of primate on which to collect behavioural data. This data will then be used to answer a research question based in one of the theories learned in lecture. Finally, theory and data will be put in the context of primate conservation and how we best conserve the world\u2019s primates.\u00a0",

So what makes plants \u201ctick\u201d, and can they be improved so that the negative environmental impacts of intensive cropping can be balanced with ensuring food security? Modern plant science holds unprecedented opportunities to link processes at the genetic, molecular and physiological level to patterns at the overall plant level so that future food security can be achieved without compromising the environment. This multidisciplinary course encompasses molecular biology, genetics, plant physiology and development, as well as how plants respond to abiotic stress.\u00a0This course exposes you to an exciting breadth of contemporary plant sciences so you can develop an understanding of this rapidly changing and fundamental field. You will develop skills and techniques important in contemporary plant science.

These are the big questions ecology addresses.\n\u00a0\nThis course will focus on quantifying how interactions between individuals and their environment shape populations, and how populations of one species are, in turn, affected by other species. The core principles governing ecological interactions are universal, applying at scales ranging from the microscopic (e.g., bacteria and viruses) to those of ecosystems surrounding us. They play out over timescales ranging from minutes to millions of years. They apply to both natural and managed environments. By understanding and quantifying ecological interaction we can make models describing the past and predicting what will happen in the future. This way of thinking is particularly valuable today, as human behaviour drives the ecology around us, and we need to forecast the consequences of our actions.\n\u00a0\nThis course will take a hands-on data-driven approach, with field trips, workshops and discussions focused on illustrating key ecological concepts. We will leverage the power of the R programming language to visualise data, whether empirical, or simulated by our mathematical models. One course highlight is a three-day field trip to the Kioloa Coastal Campus, that will allow you to design, carry out and analyse a small ecological study..\n\nNote: Graduate students attend joint classes with undergraduates but are assessed separately.",

If so, did you know that your test results could help you to trace your ethnic background, find missing relatives and even help the police find a murderer? Have you ever wondered why you are a similar height to your siblings - is it because of your genes, or because of the environment you grew up in? Why do traits vary even when their underlying DNA sequence is exactly the same? What role does genetics play in your risk of developing diseases such as diabetes?\n\nThis course will introduce you to the principles of population, evolutionary and quantitative genetics. We do this by asking: what can we learn from DNA? In answering this question, we focus on the practical applications of the theory illustrated by human forensic DNA analysis, conservation genetics and evolutionary genetics. In the practical component of the course, students will gain hands-on experience in human forensic DNA profiling in the laboratory, as well as statistical analysis skills across a range of genetic topics.

It is about understanding how evolutionary biologists do research, and getting to grips with how we can design tests or experiments that tell us about processes that happen over timescales longer than a human life, or events that occurred millions of years ago. For example, how do we test ideas about why some birds are brightly coloured and others dull? How can we reconstruct the events that result in one species splitting into two? How can we explain why there are so many species in tropical rainforests?

How does a goose fly over the Himalayas in the intense cold and low oxygen that would kill a human in minutes? Answers to these questions rely on a strong understanding of how plants and animals operate at all levels, from cells to organs. For an organism to function in the natural environment physiological processes must work together. If we understand these processes we can better predict how plants and animals will respond to environmental stress. For example, we can then work out how extreme temperatures and drought brought about by climate change will affect local rates of extinction. We can explore the tricks that allow some species to survive in seemingly inhospitable environments across our planet. This knowledge can offer novel engineering insights into the design of our own buildings, transport systems and even cities (biomimetics is a growing and exciting field). \n\u00a0\nPlant and animal systems are rich in their diversity and have evolved striking parallels in how hormones and other biomolecules interact in day-to-day life. These interactions govern all metabolic processes that affect growth and performance. In this course we will help you to see both the shared and unique features of plant and animal physiology that underpin the evolution of biodiversity. \n\u00a0\nPhysiology is not just fascinating; it\u2019s crucial to our survival and well-being. Students will learn concepts that can be applied to an array of real-world problems including: 1) predicting how species distributions will change in response to climate change; 2) improving conservation outcomes for endangered plants and animals; 3) how anthropogenic stressors, such as overfishing, pollution and the introduction of invasive species impact physiology and can increase the risk of population extinction; 4) designing crops to ensure future food security.\n\nNote: Graduate students attend joint classes with undergraduates but are assessed separately.",

This course offers an overview of the biological and molecular bases of important parasitic diseases and an understanding of the enormous impact parasites have on endemic communities. \n\nIn this course we will take a broad and multi-disciplinary approach to the complex and dynamic relationships between parasites and their hosts. We aim to understand the problems we face when fighting parasitic diseases and to identify potential solutions. We will explore both unicellular parasites (protozoa) and multicellular parasites (mainly parasitic worms and ectoparasites). We will also investigate overarching themes like mechanisms that cause disease, transmission, diagnostics, drug development and intervention strategies. \n\nThe diverse and comprehensive lecture series is complemented by hands-on practicals that will emphasise particular aspects. These practicals will also provide insights into the current state of parasitological research and strategies that are employed to develop new drugs and diagnostics. \n\u00a0\nNote: Graduate students attend joint classes with undergraduates but are assessed separately",

Understanding these cellular activities enables us to appreciate the normal functions of living cells, to explain the molecular basis of diseases and inspires the development of new treatments.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis course deals with the basic physiology of cells and the origins of disease, with a particular emphasis on membrane transport processes. \u00a0The proteins that control entry and exit to the cell provide the fundamental interface between cells and their surroundings, controlling such things as the electrical excitability of nerves, the secretion of hormones and the uptake of drugs. This course will cover the following topics: cell and membrane structure and function; membrane channels and transporters and their roles in nutrient uptake, ion homeostasis, cell signalling and drug resistance; the electrical properties of membranes; the cellular and molecular basis of the excitability of the nervous system; excitation-contraction coupling in muscle; signal transduction; the molecular structure and function of membrane transport proteins; the molecular basis of the action of a number of drugs; diseases involving transporter and channel defects. Specific examples include explaining the molecular origins of epilepsy and designing novel treatments for malaria.\n\u00a0\nStudents will comprehend how molecular processes give rise to cellular function, and gain the ability to apply this knowledge to explain the basis of a range of human diseases. The course is designed to provide skills to those wanting to apply their chemical knowledge as well as those anticipating a future career in medical sciences.

We want to help you to sift out fake news, identify misleading ways to describe data and allow you to assess the importance of\u00a0different factors in explaining the patterns we see in the world. This is a core life skill. And, naturally, if you take this course you\u2019ll be better equipped to take the path to becoming a biologist yourself. \n\u00a0\nThis course will explore the ways biologists design experiments, generate data and assess evidence using a variety of statistical techniques. We will discuss the value of different scientific approaches, including hypothesis-driven experiments and exploration of large-scale data generation\u2013such as genome and transcriptome sequencing projects. We\u2019ll consider examples from microbial, animal and plant biology, and you will carry out exercises to develop and test hypotheses, and critically interpret the results. You will have the opportunity to participate in all stages of a biological experiment. This will include the conception and design of a study, laboratory work, analysis of the data, drawing conclusions, writing the report and engaging graphical ways to present your findings. The R programming language will be taught and used throughout the course. Students will be required to use their laptop computers.\n\nNote: Graduate students attend joint classes with undergraduates but are assessed separately.",

In the first half of the course we cover the enormous diversity of terrestrial, marine and aquatic invertebrate animals, from insects and spiders to molluscs, rotifers and corals. In the second half we cover the enigmatic Australian fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals, with a particular focus on their diversity and natural history. The course includes contributions from researchers at the CSIRO Australian National Insect Collection and the Australian National Wildlife Collection, both located in Canberra.\u00a0On a 3-day field trip to the coast you will gain a solid grounding in identifying the most common marine and terrestrial invertebrate fauna of south-eastern Australia and the habitats that they occupy. Lab practicals throughout the course focus on hands-on learning about key features of structures and how they function, specimen preservation and the use of biological keys for species identification. We have designed this course to complement other third year courses in ecology, evolution, biodiversity and conservation. It is fun, interesting and interactive.

While in tropical rainforests, they have evolved to deal with wet, often dark conditions where they rarely encounter other members of their own species. Finding suitable places to settle, grow and reproduce is a challenge. In both environments plants and animals have evolved special morphologies, physiologies and behaviours that influence the way they interact with other species, and that allow them deal with extreme conditions.\n\nIf you would like to conduct original field research on plants and animals in a beautiful field site, this intensive residential field course may be for you. The advanced version of this course is aimed at students who have completed 2000 level science courses and are interested to explore and develop an independent research project. Working with practitioners, students develop independent field research projects in plant and animal ecology. We explore the ways that diverse organisms respond to conditions in their environments and acquire the resources they need to survive, grow and reproduce: their functional ecology. The course location varies among years, but regardless of location the same theoretical principles will be explored in the context of protected area management, conservation and climate change. \n\u00a0\nBy exploring the functional ecology of plants and animals simultaneously, students develop an understanding of the differences and commonalities among organisms. Students develop skills in research including project design and execution, data analysis and interpretation, and oral and written presentation of results. Students will get to apply a wide array of field techniques used in ecophysiology and behavioural ecology. Students will also engage in supported peer mentoring and peer review processes. \n\u00a0\nOur aim is to give participants a chance to do real science and to embrace being an independent scientist. In addition to the hard research skills, we explore keys to effective collaboration and collegial interactions. The experience enables students to approach their later year studies with a new perspective and will provide real-world skills relevant in both science and non-science careers.\n\nNote: Graduate students attend joint classes with undergraduates but are assessed separately.",

A global network of supply chain partners facilitates the purchasing, production, and distribution activities of multinational companies to create value in products or services for international markets. Effective and efficient management of the global supply chain can enhance the global competitiveness of firms. Using a combination of lectures, case studies and seminar discussion, the course explores the main issues in global supply chain management (SCM) to underline their strategic importance to firms. It first places SCM in the context of international business. It then discusses the core concepts of SCM, supply chain strategies, and key operations. The later part of the course focuses on the designing of global supply chain to counter risks, enhance efficiency, and promote sustainability.",

These approaches do not start with identifying and solving problems, but instead start with framing questions about these systems, their building blocks and the dynamic relationships between their human, technological, and environmental components. Students will learn to engage with important terminology and detail, integrate multiple perspectives, question assumptions, and think critically and creatively in order to start with framing questions about emerging cyber-physical systems and the future we want to collectively create with them.\n\nThis course gives students exposure to conceptual approaches of the new branch of engineering. It draws on cybernetics, systems and control theory, design thinking and practice, scientific method, social science, humanities, and critical theory.

They will also gain technical skills in designing, building and understanding such systems, and understanding Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) from the \u2018inside\u2019, with an emphasis on making and building. This complements the approach in CECS6001 and CECS6002, which challenge participants to consider CPSs from the \u2018outside\u2019 via interrogating case studies.\n\nParticipants will not emerge from the course as qualified programmers or computer scientists.

He was particularly interested in understanding systems level interactions and feedback loops that encompassed biological, technical and human systems. Wiener\u2019s early explorations of the topic brought together anthropologists, psychologists, biologists, philosophers, and early proponents of computing. This work formed the intellectual bedrock for much of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) agenda that would follow. Whilst the work was supplanted in the United States by AI and Computer Science, it continued to evolve and expand in Europe and Latin America. Today, cyber-physical systems, or CPS, are often viewed as the application of cybernetics, and the course will explore CPS in this context. ",

            "description": "Cybernetic or cyber-physical systems (CPS), already surround us, and are increasingly being designed to make decisions that previously required human insight and input. In order to ensure humanity maximally benefits from these new advances in technology, the world will need practitioners who can holistically consider and manage the potential impacts of CPS on humans, each other, and our world.\n\nAssurance is the mechanism by which risk is identified and managed in an informed and strategic way. Identifying, predicting, and mitigating risk is already known to be a challenging proposition in complex technical systems, but the possibility that a CPS is capable of evolving beyond its initial state adds an additional dimension to this challenge.\n\nThere has been a great deal of focus on ethics as it relates to assuring components of CPS, including advanced artificial intelligence, data analytics, algorithmic-based decision making and next generation process automation. If we can program a CPS with ethical guidelines, the reasoning goes, then it will make decisions in line with human interest, even as it learns from its surroundings. But ethics are socio-cultural objects, which is to say they are contextual, cultural, contingent and contested. They change over time, and across geographies and cultures. Building ethics into technical systems is a complicated proposition. \n\nSafely scaling technical systems will take more than just an awareness of ethics; it will also require awareness of existing, and the creation of new, assurance and risk management practices. In this context, assurance is the mechanism by which risk is identified and managed in an informed and strategic way.",

Throughout this course, students will be exploring a selection of the wide range of subject matter and geographic regions that encompass medical anthropology. We will begin with the cultural conventions of biomedicine situated in the West and then incorporate some of the healing practices and medical afflictions around the world studied by medical anthropologists. Overall, the thematic topics include: theories of disease causation and healing efficacy; medicalization and the scientific gaze; production of medical knowledge; mental health; public health discourse and risk; the internationalization of pharmaceutical research; the possibilities and perils of new medical technologies; emergent forms of everyday health practices; the ethics of medical tourism; and health inequities.

            "description": "This course introduces cross-cultural comparative perspectives on indigenous medicines, healing and health in colonial and post-colonial contexts. Contemporary condition of indigenous medicines and healing practices in Australia, Hawaii, Africa, India, and Southeast Asian nations, for example, are intertwined with the history of European colonial racial and gendered objectification of \u201cnative\u201d bodies, their medicines and healing approaches. We will examine the relationship between medicine as a tool of empire and how indigenous medicines,\u00a0healthcare practices, and health have been constructed, regulated, and transformed by colonial and post-colonial science, medicine, and social policies. We will also explore how\u00a0indigenous conceptions of the body, health, and approaches to care\u00a0persist as distinctive from contemporary biomedical paradigm.\u00a0We will explore the effects of this distinction on indigenous medicines, healing practices, and health\u2014that today is also manifest in clinical settings worldwide as a cultural tension between the biomedical doctor and the indigenous patient. Part 1 of the course will focus on the relationship between colonial medicine and indigenous medicines. Part 2 will focus on indigenous forms of medicines and conception of health and healing. Part 3 will focus on the contemporary forms of indigenous medicines and the health of indigenous people in light of the re-emergence of molecular biology, genetic science and the rise of cultural competency paradigm in biomedicine. In the process,\u00a0students will gain a historical understanding of key concepts associated with the construction of indigenous medicines such as ethnomedicine, traditional, alternative, and medical pluralism vis-\u00e0-vis the idea of what is modern and the formation of modernity.\u00a0",

Broadly, the course explores the sociocultural, ethical, risk, and regulatory issues that arise out of global biomedical applications of biotechnologies in a variety of transnational contexts. The course will consider how transformations in biological sciences influence clinical practice. Here, drawing from ethnographic studies, we will examine the extant role of molecular and genomic sciences in redefining medical care and patient decision about care. We will reflect on the relationship between genetic determinism and epigenomics in biomedical research and clinical practice. The course will also explore socio-cultural effects of the globalization of reproductive technologies and surrogacy services along with anthropological debates surrounding the medical market for eggs and sperm and the outsourcing of medical research and drug clinical trials. Here we will reflect on the relationship between pharmaceuticals, the global market, and public health. Throughout the course, we will be concerned with social implication of biotechnologies at the intersection of race, gender, class, and sexuality as we reflect on the unequal benefits and risks of biomedical research and the applications of biotechnologies. Students will be introduced to the anthropological and political economic analysis of medical tourism, reproductive tourism, and the politics of transnational organ transfer to reflect on questions such as: Why some patients cross national borders for care while other individuals are compelled to sacrifice their organs for the care of their family?",

We will then apply our knowledge of rhetorical style to an analysis of famous examples of persuasive discourse and writing from the modern era, such as Martin Luther King Jr's \"Letter from Birmingham Jail\", John F. Kennedy's \"Inaugural Address\" and the speeches of Winston Churchill, Sir Robert Menzies and Paul Keating.

Additionally, it introduces topics which cut across many computer systems, such as cross-layer communication and basic concurrency (as well as basic ideas of virtualization and efficiency through proximity).\nCPU architectures are discussed from first principles (digital logic) and are expanded into current day designs. This also involves assembler level programming to connect hardware circuits to the world of software. Representations of data types and high-level code at the machine level will be made clear by keeping the relations between high-level and machine-level code throughout the course. It will also look at how concurrent software constructs can or cannot be translated into parallel hardware operations. This course will cover a wide range of topics such as digital logic: transistors, gates, and combinatorial circuits; clocks; registers and register banks; arithmetic-logic units; data representation: big-endian and littleendian integers; ones and twos complement arithmetic; signed and unsigned values; Von-Neumann architecture and bottleneck; instruction sets; RISC and CISC designs; instruction pipelines and stalls; rearranging code; memory and address spaces; physical and virtual memory; interleaving; page tables; memory caches; bus architecture; polling and interrupts; DMA; device programming; assembly language; optimizations; concurrency and parallelism; and data pipelining.\nKnowledge of the principles of networking and operating systems (as well as their relation to computer hardware) are essential for every computer scientist and this course will provide those foundations. The relation of assembler level building blocks (macros) to constructs in direct compiled language is demonstrated throughout the course.\nWhile this course provides the above foundations (which stand on their own), it also prepares students for the follow-up course COMP6310 Systems, Networks and Concurrency, which rounds off the knowledge about concurrency in current computer systems of any scale, as well as expands the knowledge in networking and operating systems.",

It expands particularly into all forms of concurrent programming including aspects of massively parallel programming.\nThis course introduces all basic mechanisms to analyse, design, and manage concurrent, single computer-node (multicore) as well as distributed applications (e.g. as performance or dependability enhancements).\nFollowing on from the previous course, the fields of operating systems and networking will also be expanded on. On the operating system side aspects of security, scheduling algorithms and memory management are discussed. More specific networking aspects follow on from message passing as a core concurrency construct. These include the basics of routing and dependable protocols.\n\t\u00a0",

More specifically, we use the model provided by a programming language to discuss concepts, formulate algorithms, and reason about problem solutions. Programming languages define models tailored to thinking about and solving problems in intended application areas. For example, the C language provides a model close to a computer\u2019s underlying hardware [\u2026]. The languages used in practice change continuously as advances in our field and the broadening uses of technology change how we model and express computation. At its core, the study of programming languages examines the principles and limitations of computing (or programming) models, the effective design and use of systems or languages based on these models, and methods to compare their relative strengths and weaknesses in particular contexts.\u201d [Why Undergraduates Should Learn the Principles of Programming Languages, ACM SIGPLAN Education Board, February 6, 2011, Page 1]\n\nThis course is an introduction to the theory and design of programming languages. To develop high-assurance software - software for which we can give strong evidence that the software will do what it is supposed to do and nothing more - a formal description of the 'meaning' and behaviour of programs is required. Hence two fundamental aspects of the study of programming languages are their syntax, and their formal semantics. High-assurance software is not only needed for safety-critical software, but also for program transformations, such as carried out by optimising compilers.\n\nTopics covered in this course include formal semantics of programming languages (such as operational, denotational and axiomatic), type systems, higher-order functions and lambda calculus, concurrency, and communication.",

With an understanding of how the microprocessor executes programs, the course then shows how a high-level programming language such as C makes those abstractions concrete, and exposes the static and dynamic structures of programs. Students learn the organisation principles of a simple microprocessor, how it can be realised in a simulator, and programmed in assembly. Students also build a non-trivial real-world application in the C programming language.\n\nMore specifically, the course covers:\nIntroduction to digital systems and logic, including Boolean algebra, logic gates, and combinational logicInstruction set architecture (ISA) design principles with a specific focus on the ARM ISAMicroarchitecture of a simple ARM processorMemory and I/O systemsC programming language, translation of C programs to ARM assembly, and C program runtime organization including call stack and heapBasic I/O utilities in C and memory mapped I/ORelationship between programming language abstractions and assembly code",

Through a series of practical workshops, students will develop an appreciation for the characteristics and capabilities of each language, and will discover that a good deal of effort and diligence is required to produce useful models. This experience will prepare students to make and implement decisions regarding the appropriate use of modelling throughout the software development life-cycle.\n\t\u00a0\n\tStudents will also learn how to integrate several modelling languages to form specifications that are unambiguous, consistent and understandable. They will then be introduced to various approaches for verifying such specifications and translating them into executable software.

To that end, the computer needs to use sensors such as RGB or depth sensors to interact with the world. It mainly includes the understanding of the environment (scene understanding), humans, and further interaction with humans. Mapping to specific computer vision problems, this course will cover advanced topics in computer vision, such as 1) Scene Understanding,\u00a02)Graphical Models,\u00a03)3D visual perception , 4) Human Analysis and modeling.\u00a0This course will review current research literature in the above fields and update students with state-of-the-art techniques. Students will work on group projects related to concrete research problems and present their research results in the form of seminars.",

A number of important areas are reviewed including: (1) theories used by criminologists and economists to explain crime and delinquency; (2) modern prevention models; (3) specialised techniques used by economists in studying crime and delinquency; and (4) areas of substantive expertise where economists contribute to scholarship and crime and justice policy development. The course begins by introducing the conceptual foundations that underpin the course followed by an introduction into the economics of crime and enforcement. The various theories, perspectives and methods outlined in the early part of the course provide the necessary foundation for investigating topics such as organised crime, illicit drugs and alcohol and prohibition.",

We consider the key issues associated with the identification and management of social problems and contemplate how behavioural disobedience, as a moral resource, is purposefully exploited for political and commercial ends. Using a set of case studies (or crime control 'controversies') as evidence, students will address the following key questions:- How are social problems defined and policed?- To what degree is public understanding of crime culturally mediated and influenced by specific rhetorics?- Which groups and interests effectively dictate crime control policies and criminal justice system agendas?- What are the social consequences of intensifications in criminalization processes and securitization projects?Overall, this course equips students with the appropriate knowledge, acuity and research skills to understand and engage the contemporary crime control landscape from a critically informed perspective.",

Drug use on the other hand is much less common but no less problematic, accounting for\u00a0 between 20 and 40 percent of crimes committed in Australia. How we respond to these issues remains a matter of significant academic and policy debate - especially for those charged with the responsibility of promoting safety, both on the streets and in the home.This course examines the social, legal and political responses to alcohol and drug use in contemporary Australian society. Students will explore their own perceptions of the drug-crime relationship and contrast these with the theoretical frameworks that currently exist to guide policy and practice. In particular, this course focuses heavily on current law enforcement and social policy responses to alcohol and drug related crime, examining existing policies and practices such as drug courts, treatment institutions, and early referral into treatment programs.",

Dynamic design embraces the constant change and variability of digital media, crafting flexible, interactive systems. Generative design takes up the potential of computing as a process, using rules and systems to create otherwise impossible physical and visual forms. The designed systems that result can give rise to endless variations in form and outcome, challenging traditional notions of design and object. To explore these ideas and opportunities, this course takes a practical, production-focused approach to computer-based generative techniques and design for dynamic content.

There are an increasing number of global and regional issues which can only be managed through diplomatic processes, not through the use of force. But how best to manage these issues is exceptionally challenging. For example, the increase in violent international terrorism is putting the debate about whether diplomacy is a necessary but not sufficient management under the spotlight. Moreover, there are other types of challenges that are the result of new methods of practicing diplomacy, such as digital diplomacy and network diplomacy. Into the mix, the increasing networks of state-based diplomats and non-state actors, raise questions about the exact nature of diplomatic challenges from the perspective of the different players.\u00a0 \u00a0These challenges raise practical and intellectual questions. For example, in a globalising and interdependent world exactly what comprises states\u2019 interests and who decides \u2013 how do the representatives of the state, the state-based diplomats, attempt to reconcile their state\u2019s national interests around issues that require collective action. What does sovereignty mean today and how do state-based diplomats and non-state actors frame and negotiate sovereignty? How are global and regional multilateral institutions and regimes negotiated and in whose interests and values? Is international law or politics the structure that directs diplomatic agency and practice? Does the analysis of diplomatic practices concerned with contemporary diplomatic challenges provide generalisations that inform a theory of practice?\u00a0",

But much has changed. The revolution in communications technology provides political units (now states and organisations) and global citizens with real-time digital, verbal and visual connections. How, why and what the implications of such changes are for future theories and practices of diplomacy is puzzling and a matter of much debate.\nBy taking the longue dur\u00e9e, the long view, and analysing continuities and changes in the forms and functions of diplomacy from its origins to present times, this course aims to engage you in the debate about diplomacy and equip you with ideas that help you develop your own arguments about the theoretical and practical directions that will sustain diplomacy in the digital age, at a time when managing national and global issues cooperatively has never been more critical.",

The region has experienced what former Kiribati President Anote Tong aptly called a 'paradigm shift' in ideas about how Pacific diplomacy should be organised, and on what principles it should operate. Many leaders have called for a heightened Pacific voice in global affairs and a new commitment to establishing Pacific Island control of diplomatic processes. \nThis change in thinking has been expressed in the establishment of new channels and arenas for Pacific diplomacy at the regional and global levels and new ways of connecting the two levels through active use of intermediate diplomatic associations. This 'new' Pacific diplomacy has seen real success in diplomatic outcomes in key sectors of global negotiations for Pacific states such as fisheries, climate policy, decolonisation and trade. \nThis course examines this new diplomatic agency on the part of Pacific Island states and explores its impact on relations with larger states - such as Australia, China, France and Indonesia - as well as on the shape of the regional institutional architecture. It also questions what this experience tells us about the power of small states to influence diplomatic outcomes in world affairs.  ",

This course explores the causes of conflict (and peace) and examines various mechanisms that are employed by the international community in an attempt to address interstate and intrastate conflict. It also provides students with an opportunity to study the theory and practice of the essential diplomatic art of negotiation. This course introduces and examines the international framework for negotiation and conflict resolution. It surveys the causes and character of conflict and explores a wide range of mechanisms for inter-state and intra-state conflict resolution. Three broad and topical concepts of diplomacy - 'preventive diplomacy', 'coercive diplomacy' and 'peacebuilding diplomacy' - are used to demarcate different phases and types of conflict management. In our consideration of preventive diplomacy we examine the preventive measures of peaceful settlement contained in Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter, such as negotiation, mediation, arbitration and adjudication. In our examination of coercive diplomacy we discuss coercive measures for preventing and resolving conflict, such as sanctions and use of force provided for in Chapter VII of the UN Charter. Finally, we use the notion of peacebuilding diplomacy to examine the mechanisms that help shape peacebuilding interventions in conflict and post-conflict zones, such as peace processes and multidimensional peace operations.\n\nAs part of this course students undertake an intensive negotiation workshop. This flagship element of the Master of Diplomacy program provides students with first-hand exposure to the challenges of managing conflict through diplomatic negotiation. You will acquire and refine new negotiation and mediation skills and techniques through a variety of learning methods, including workshop discussion, demonstration, practice and simulation. The Negotiation Workshop aims to develop the ability of students to think politically and strategically, to examine key elements in the planning and conduct of negotiation and mediation, to identify essential qualities and skills for effective negotiation and mediation, and to consolidate this knowledge through practical exercises that simulate real-world diplomatic negotiations.",

Such situations often lead to market failures that are characterised by environmental degradation or the overexploitation of natural resources.\n\nThis course analyses the economic principles underlying the design of efficient environmental policies and the optimal management of natural resources. It identifies conditions under which market failures lead to environmental degradation or to the overexploitation of natural resources, and discusses economic policies that can counteract such market failures. Such policies include imposing taxes on certain economic activities, or allocating property rights that allow these activities to be undertaken. If property rights\u2014which may take the form of pollution permits, or individual quotas for the harvesting of natural resources\u2014are transferable between agents, the trade of property rights between self-interested agents yields economic efficiency as a market-based outcome.",

We will study\u00a0foundational topics in behavioral economics, with a focus on theories of behavior that aim to incorporate non-standard phenomena into classic economic models, with consideration of intertemporal decision-making, choice under uncertainty, and learning.\n\nThe course will be centered around research paper discussions, allowing students to develop the critical skills necessary to evaluate and put in practice the latest research findings in the field of Behavioral Economics.

Governments want to measure the impact of their policy changes on society as a whole, while private agents focus on the impact they have on their own welfare and the welfare of those they care about. In markets subject to tax and other distortions market prices are not normally reliable measures of the social valuation of goods and services. Thus, they cannot be used to evaluate the social impact of policy and other changes. Instead, we derive shadow prices of goods and services to look through market distortions and measure social valuations. When changes in economic activity are evaluated using these shadow prices they provide measures of the social impact of policy and other changes.\nThis course summarises the information provided by different welfare measures for single consumers and then looks at ways to aggregate them over consumers. In doing so, we examine ways to account for distributional effects in policy evaluation. Tax reform and the optimal provision of public goods are examined as applications of these shadow pricing rules.",

The corresponding techniques are built on models of decision-making by economic agents, in environments with and without uncertainty, and on the analysis of interacting economic agents, in various settings such as markets or strategic situations. This course introduces the main techniques of microeconomics, at a level that lies between that of typical undergraduate courses, and that of Masters or PhD level courses. The results are presented and analysed using both intuitive graphical and formal mathematical methods. An important aim of the course is to show that the intuition gained from simple graphical models, and the insight derived from formal theoretical analysis are complementary, and that only the interplay between economic intuition and abstract results can lead to a complete understanding of the respective models and the conclusions drawn from their analysis.",

The public choice perspective places more emphasis on modelling the political process and argues that this, like the market mechanism, has readily identifiable sources of failure.",

Legal issues examined in the course include property rights, tort law, contract law, criminal law, law enforcement and punishment, litigation and settlement, principal-agent liability, and regulation v tort law as ways to control externalities.\nThe emphasis in this course is on \u201cthinking like an economist\u201d to understand legal issues from an economic perspective, with a focus on a clear understanding of the logic and underlying economic intuition rather than just the results.\nLaw and Economics is an interesting application of the economic way of thinking to real world problems and policy issues. Examining actual legal cases gives students experience in relating abstract economic models to practical problems and demonstrates their direct relevance.\nGraduate students do the pass course together with extra lectures on more advanced topics and extensions to the pass course. The extra topics will be drawn from: welfare economics, competition and the core, the hold-out problem, the anti-commons, intellectual property and patents, non-pecuniary losses and the value of life, the last clear chance rule, product liability with monopoly, and more complete models of accidents, optimal contract damages and uncertainty.",

Environmental economics can help inform policy decisions that balance costs and benefits, and on the choice and design of policy instruments. Environmental economics also provides insights into the economic causes of environmental problems and how to remedy them through the application of policy instruments.Environmental economics mainly uses theories and methods from micro-economics, namely analysis of individual and firm decision-making and markets. However understanding the evolution of environmental quality, environment and trade, and sustainability also requires knowledge of some macro-economics, that is the study of the overall national and global economy. Economic research heavily uses statistical methods (econometrics) and so it is important for students to understand some basic statistical concepts.\u00a0",

Weekly interviews with world leading researchers on each topic provide additional perspectives that complement the lecture content. Students are expected to engage enthusiastically with weekly reading and writing tasks, and conduct original analyses of current environment and climate policy issues.

In twenty of the poorest 48 nations, tourism is either the first or second earner of foreign income and the World Tourism Council argues that it is a powerful force for alleviating world poverty. \n\nWhat pre-conditions are needed for that to be true? Who benefits and who pays the costs from major tourism development projects?\u00a0Does tourism change the way in which the host communities see themselves? What are the long term impacts resulting from the interaction of different cultures? Where do World Heritage sites and national parks fit in the mix? How does tourism affect Indigenous peoples living in World Heritage designated regions? Are there tensions between tourism and\u00a0mining, agriculture and urban and coastal development? What are the challenges for the social welfare, education and health sectors? Does tourism promote corruption? How successful are certification programs in promoting sustainability and socially responsible behaviour?

Water is critical for all life, as well as agriculture, manufacturing, energy production and other industries. As water demand grows, systems are increasingly stressed through modification by dams, pollution and climate change. Longstanding approaches to water management have been driven by the techno-engineering solutions, while more recent paradigms aim to integrate human rights and environmental conservation. \n\nThe course, Water Justice examines how water\u2019s benefits and costs are shared and by whom. It applies a water justice lens by drawing on the diverse literatures on social justice, environmental justice, settler-colonial relations, and gender studies. Students will consider links between water (in)justices and other forms of social inequality, and examine issues of power, conflict and equity. They will also reflect upon relevant water governance concepts including management, policy, decision-making and infrastructure. The politics that underpin water decision-making will also be examined, particularly the challenges and approaches for more equitable representation of diverse interests across communities and nations in water governance, and a fairer distribution of costs and benefits. Learning will take place through case studies that will explore politics of transboundary water bodies, unsustainable groundwater extraction, policy capture by powerful stakeholders, conflicts around water markets, and debates about dams and other large water infrastructure, among others.\u00a0",

Decarbonisation will require changes in technologies, production and consumption, and means transition in some industries. Meanwhile, communities and businesses will need to prepare for impacts from climate change and adapt to them. Climate policy is contested and poses challenges for institutions and political decision making.\u00a0\n\nThis course is about the frameworks, choice and design of policy for climate change at the national and sub-national level. It provides an introduction to the principles of domestic policymaking for climate change, and their application in practice. It allows students to become familiar with some of the major debates on climate change policy in the economic and political context, including selected current policy debates in Australia and other countries. The course provides a grounding to enable students to do their own analysis of climate policy instruments and options. Students are encouraged to actively engage and share their own perspectives. The course covers economic concepts, these are presented in a way that is accessible to non-economists and the course does not require prior study of economics.",

            "description": "There are considerable concerns about how rising atmospheric CO2 will affect Earth's climate and marine biogeochemistry in the future. Computer simulations are used to predict future climate changes, but these projections remain very uncertain and the capacity of climate models to reproduce long-term change needs to be thoroughly tested. The only way to do this is by testing model performance against geological archives of past climate changes.\nYou will examine how geoscientists reconstruct past climate changes combining data from the oceans, atmosphere, ice sheets, land surfaces, and vegetation, and how these relate to reconstructed changes in energy supply from the sun. One important topic that we will cover, for example, concerns the reasons for past atmospheric CO2 changes, and how these influenced the global climate, as well as conditions in the oceans.\nThe course covers the essential aspects needed for understanding the Earth's climate system such as Earth's energy balance; climate sensitivity; sea level and ice sheet changes; ocean circulation changes; nutrient cycling and atmospheric CO2 variations. These subjects are covered using marked events in Earth history. You will learn how the geochemistry of natural palaeoclimate archives and numerical models is used to reconstruct the history of the climate system and identify the causes of climate change. Geochemical tools and proxies, and geophysical methods, for reconstructing climate changes through Earth's history will be explained. You will learn how to use box models to understand nutrient cycling and atmospheric CO2 changes. We will look in more detail at: the nature of, and relationships between, high-resolution ice-core records from Greenland and Antarctica; abrupt climate changes; the factors that affect short-term climate variability in Australia and how these are currently changing; and the science related to common misconceptions in climate change discussions. A key outcome of this course will be a firm understanding of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that control Earth's climate, and how they may interact to modulate climate change in the future.\nIn addition to research-based lectures and practicals, journal articles of greater conceptual difficulty will be made available for students who wish to explore their personal interests in climate change. The teaching material is focused around areas of active palaeoclimate research and presents students with an overview of the latest international scientific understanding of past climate changes and their relevance to the future.\n\nNOTE: Postgraduate students will attend classes with undergraduate students but will be assessed differently. This will be expected to lead to a greater capacity of integrated information interpretation across the different lines of evidence, and a deeper systemic comprehension that will support a more structural outlook with respect to the current climate crisis. Accordingly, there will be greater expected depth in the essay/report and more comprehensive questioning in the exam.\n\u00a0",

A broad background to the physics and fluid dynamics of mantle convection will be provided in this course, by explaining what it is, how it works, and how to quantify it in simple terms. It assumes no specialist background: mechanisms will be explained simply and the required basic physics will be fully reviewed and explained. The distinctive forms that convection takes within Earth's mantle will be described within the context of tectonic plates and mantle plumes, whilst the implications for geochemistry and Earth's tectonic evolution will be explored. Common misconceptions and controversies will be addressed, providing a straightforward, but rigorous, explanation of this key process. Emerging insights into the fundamental links between climate, surface processes (weathering, erosion and sediment transport), plate tectonics and underlying mantle flow will also be covered, thus providing a complete overview of Earth\u2019s dynamic engine.\n\nNote: This course is co-taught with undergraduate students but assessed separately.",

Fables and fairy tales, experiments with realism or magical realism are all present in various forms of the contemporary short story, and stem from writers being influenced by past narratives and/or by reacting to their peers. This course will encourage students to read a variety of classical and contemporary short stories and to experiment with different styles and genres which have developed over the past two centuries, and which are still being questioned or utilised by contemporary authors.Students will be expected to write two short stories and/or a few chapters of a novel in this course. Draft stories will be revised. The final versions of students' stories will be arrived at through discussion in seminars and workshops, and through the reading of published fiction. The course will include some consideration of the practical processes involved in publishing stories and longer works.",

In this course we will read a variety of Victorian texts in the context of nineteenth-century anxieties and discourses about sexual transgression, gender roles, disease, madness, spiritualism, the experience of modernity and the problem of the body. We will read a range of literary forms including novels, novellas, short stories, plays and poetry, and both canonical and non-canonical texts, enabling us to understand the breadth of Victorian writers' achievement and the way that Victorian literature both participated in and emerged from debates in other cultural discourses such as medicine, psychology, sociology and philosophy. The inclusion of texts from other areas of Europe, Australia and America may provide the opportunity to test the connotations and the limits of the term \"Victorian\" as a lens through which to study the output of this productive period.",

The proliferation of YouTube, Facebook and multimodal adaptations in recent years has only reignited and reformulated these discussions.\nThis course critically examines a series of texts together with their adaptations on to different kinds of screens,\u00a0in order to understand the differences between novels, short stories, plays, film and other visual media as modes of storytelling; investigate the way the written text and its adaptation participate in debates unique to their own historical contexts; and analyse the anxieties about literary and cultural value exposed by adaptations. We will ask: how do screen adaptations generate new meanings from literary texts today? Should an adaptation seek only to imitate the text or can it also transform, reconceptualise and critique it? What role do the market and the audience play in generating new meanings from texts? And can the relationship between text and adaptation be understood as mutually dependent?",

What are the social and political claims characteristic of narrative modes such as realism, naturalism, biography and autobiography, testimony and memoir?

We will do so through closely reading a selection of case studies, moving from the 1950s' 'I Love Lucy' through to 'The Simpsons', 'Twin Peaks' and to a contemporary film that is arguably inspired by contemporary televisual media (Richard Linklater's 'Boyhood'). In doing so, we will engage with some of the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries\u2019 most important theorists of television narrative (including Raymond Williams and Marshall McLuhan). Beginning with television\u2019s first emergence in the 1950s, we will consider the various ways in which television has been produced, transmitted and received. Our investigation will move from television's reliance on studio recording to thinking about the importance of live and cable broadcasting and, more recently, the role of digital devices that can stream or download content. We will ask questions about what makes televisual storytelling distinct and whether or not television has influenced the development of other forms (including novels and films). The course will conclude with our looking at how television has transformed in the contemporary era of so-called convergent or \u2018connexionist\u2019 media.\u00a0",

Informed by this foundation, students will examine in turn 3 or 4 current topics in literary and cultural studies, each running over 2-3 weeks and paired with a primary text (a novel, play, film, case study etc.). Topics might include: new theories of reading, such as \u2018distant reading\u2019, \u2018surface reading\u2019, \u2018reparative reading\u2019 etc.; animal studies; ecocriticism; theories of performance; practice-led research; theories of affect and emotion; trauma studies; memory studies; neuroscience and \u2018plasticity\u2019; each taught by scholars focusing on these areas.The course will not provide a comprehensive overview, but an exciting and varied sample of current debates. Its aim is to stimulate students to think of reading as a creative process, and of research writing as itself a form of creative reading.",

Major developments are occurring in the energy sector, both with energy technologies and the economic, social and policy measures that accompany them. This course focuses on renewable energy resources \u2013 the technologies that will comprise a large part of global Energy Change. It aims to help students identify the major \u2018big picture\u2019 questions in the area of energy resources and develop technically sound ways of quantitatively answering them.The course commences with an overview of world energy resources, the scientific evidence for climate change, and an introduction to asking good questions - with a focus on ball-park analysis and appropriate physical units.We next look at individual energy resources in detail (solar PV, nuclear, wind, solar thermal, hydro, bio, geothermal and tidal). We examine their scientific and technical foundations, available resources, integration with the grid, and broader economic and social issues to assess their ultimate potential as well as their practical limitations. Alongside the technical assessment of energy resources, we dedicated individual lectures to calculating the levelized cost of electricity, understanding the current and future electrical grid, and examining broader social and political issues concerned with energy use. Because of the rapid pace of change in this field, the course focuses on developing students\u2019 skills in framing questions and finding answers, as well as being able to critically evaluate those answers and support them with scientific evidence.",

From this problem statement, the students are responsible for developing a full set of requirements and key performance indicators to guide their proposed solution. Using a systems engineering framework and working with a high degree of autonomy, the students then proceed through a systems design process including conceptual design, sub-system requirements, and trade-off analyses. Finally, they develop and implement their engineered solution, and evaluate it against the agreed performance indicators. At the end of the project, clients take delivery\u2014and participate in the evaluation\u2014of their team's output. The course emphasises value-driven work, as evaluated in terms of: effective teamwork and peer support; impactful communication (formal and informal, written and oral); insightful personal and professional development; and elegance of engineered solutions.",

Some solutions are Multiprocessors, accelerators, custom instructions, specialized hardware.\nAlso, during this course, response time measurements of\u00a0interrupts are studied, such as for example:\u00a0the influence of dynamic memories, cache memories, compilation flags. Interrupts response time measurements, task commutations and synchronizations primitives\u00a0are carried out on an embedded system based on an FPGA.\nIn addition, the course includes the study of embedded systems management models through polling, interrupts and using a real time kernel with its task management and synchronization primitives. An Accelerator designed in Verilog makes it possible to facilitate the optimization of functions through hardware on an FPGA. Cross development tools are used.\nThis course is specifically aimed at providing practical experience through a team-based embedded system design and implementation project. Students will be required to undertake the design of an embedded system to reliably perform a designated task, such as controlling a device. They will be required to follow the steps associated with sound engineering design methodology, starting from clearly defining the problem, developing necessary technical specifications and system level design to the design of the subsystems and communication interfaces, integration and testing.

Roof-mounted PV systems are strongly competing with electricity from the grid and with gas for provision of water heating, space heating & cooling, and electrical services. Heat pumps, thermal storage, battery storage, smart electrical energy controllers, energy-efficient appliances and solar-efficient buildings are facilitating a rapid change in energy use patterns in buildings and factories. Electric cars and public transport have the potential rapidly to change urban transport systems and transport energy use patterns.\n\nThe course aims to equip students with the theoretical foundation and practical training to apply a range of commercial 3D simulation tools to generate wholesome building energy efficiency reports on the impact of building material choices and building design to the lighting, heating and cooling energy load, roof-top PV power generation potential and battery needs within a complete, integrated package.",

Cities play an increasingly critical role in local, regional and global sustainability, presenting enormous challenges but also a window of opportunity to \u201cget it right\u201d. The course will explore key topics such as the trend and impacts of global urbanization, the role of cities in sustainability, theoretical and conceptual understanding of cities as systems, analytical tools in measuring sustainability performance of cities, managing urban environment, and urban sustainability experiments and transition towards sustainability. A systems perspective is a common thread throughout the course. The course is strongly interdisciplinary, drawing on both classic and most recent literature in urban geography, urban ecology, urban environmental management, urban sustainability, systems innovation and transition. The course builds on Human Ecology, where the evolutionary history of human-nature relationships as well as a systems approach towards understanding such relationship is explored.\u00a0\n\nThis course is co-taught with undergraduate students but assessed separately.",

However, bringing about such societal change is not easy, whether it be at the global, national or local level. This course considers the complex drivers behind societal change in pursuit of environmental objectives.\n\nUsing both global and local case studies, the course will break apart some of the crucial building blocks of modern society and explore how we understand the concepts of society, environment, and the economy and the complex relationships between them. The course will also look at who \u2018we\u2019 is and how different individuals and groups experience the environment and environmental change differently. From here the course will explore how societies can and do pursue change, the complex relationships which influence change, the different discourses represented in the global conversation about environmental and social issues, and the links between international environmental movements and local, domestic environmental outcomes. In particular, the course will address such questions as: What are the key factors for successful societal change? What are the barriers? How do we know we are addressing the most critical environmental issues? And how do we know when we have succeeded?\n\nNote: Graduate students attend joint classes with undergraduates but are assessed separately.",

Students learn both the theories underpinning different PRM approaches, and practical skills such as group facilitation, stakeholder analysis and how to design and manage participatory processes. A series of guest speakers discuss recently-implemented Australian and international participatory processes, and the class evaluates the factors that affected the success or otherwise of these processes.

They range from ecologically intact to highly simplified systems; some are managed solely for their intrinsic (non-monetary) values, while others managed primarily for commercial production. Management approaches, constraints and opportunities are correspondingly diverse, although all should be underpinned by the principles of system resilience.\n\nThis course considers conceptual frameworks for managing forested landscapes with case studies of native, plantation, farm and urban forestry. Classroom learning is informed by numerous guest speakers, local field trips and discussion fora. We explore the translation of theory, policies and principles into practice by undertaking a major project analysing forest system resilience, policy options and practices of a particular form of forested landscape.

Achieving these research outcomes relies upon establishing research questions and testable hypotheses, applying appropriate data collection and analysis methods, critically assessing results, and effectively communicating the observations. That process is common to all science-based disciplines.\n\nENVS6103 uses a PPDAC (Problem, Plan, Data, Analysis, Conclusion) cycle to introduce fundamental research concepts. You can expect to develop skills in ecological measurement and sampling, and designing and conducting surveys and experiments. You will also develop analytical skills, including data exploration and effective communication and analysis techniques common to all sciences. The course promotes learning through a combination of lectures, and field-/computer-based practical exercises. During field-based exercises you will gain first-hand experience in collecting ecological and social data.\n\nGraduate students attend joint classes with undergraduates but will be assessed separately and have some separate learning activities.",

Through a coordinated series of modules, students acquire foundation knowledge across a range of environmental science disciplines. One of the world\u2019s great drainage basins, the Murray Darling Basin, is used as a case study to connect and integrate these modules into a clear narrative about the processes and issues affecting Australia's environment. In each module the case study is revisited to address topical issues and apply the learning covered in the module. By the end of the course, students will understand the Murray-Darling as an integrated system whose processes and problems reflect the biophysical and social forces that have shaped Australia.\n\nIncluded modules are:\nCreating a continent: the breakup of Gondwana - implications for geology, climate, soils and evolution of flora and fauna;Geological events that\u00a0shaped Australia: faults and rifts, volcanic activity, glaciations, sea level fluctuations;Australia's climate: climate patterns in time and space, the nature and role of climate variability, and the impacts of global warming;Australian landscape evolution: geomorphology, including effects of Aboriginal and European settlement;Water in Australia: how much, where it is, comes from and goes to, and how to regulate its use;Characterising Australian soils: soil formation and description, including aeolian deposition and land salinization - implications for productivity;Australian vegetation: coping with nutrient deficiency, water, fire, herbivory, weeds;Environmental policy and planning: linking science to policy and practice.\n\u00a0\nModules are delivered by a diverse range of disciplinary experts. Lectures are complemented by a strong practical component, in which students learn through posing questions and solving problems in panel discussions, laboratory and field classes, and an overnight excursion.\n\nThis course is co-taught with undergraduate students but assessed separately.",

            "description": "Ecosystems worldwide are under stress. Recent global and local assessments of biodiversity have reported deterioration of ecosystems and species loss, leading to potentially irreversible changes from baseline conditions. In the face of the challenges presented by multiple degrading processes, measuring and monitoring ecosystems is as important as ever. Ecosystem change may be manifest in an array of ecosystem attributes expressed as changes in number or size, or presence of species, functions, or services within an ecosystem. Despite the array of changes ecosystems may express, ecologists call upon the same broad concepts when designing and implementing approaches to quantitatively assess change and difference. This course aims to introduce the concepts at the core of measurement and monitoring for detection of ecosystem change.\n\nThe course aims to build on quantitative modelling skills using approaches that underpin the bulk of ecological studies. The intent is to provide the next step (after pre-requisite introductory courses) for students in building competence in widely applicable field-survey, data-handling and statistical methods. The ultimate aims are to provide an essential quantitative skill set for future researchers, managers, consultants, analysts, and policy-makers alike.\n\nThe dizzying array of attributes that may change in ecosystems means that this course cannot meaningfully cover a substantial number if ecosystems, attributes, or processes. The intensive timeline of the course, and uncertain public-health landscape, means we cannot travel to remote sites. The course focusses on local case studies that offer the opportunity to explore the use of data experimental sites as well as native ecosystems. While these case studies may seem, at times, distant from the idealised landscapes ecologists work in, they embody the basic question types that ecologists seek to answer when monitoring ecosystems in an approachable setting. They also support integration of lecture, workshop and reading material. Individual sessions will focus on specific examples of measurement and the impact of instrument selection and use; experimental design and implicit consequences; common and advanced analysis techniques.\n\nNote: Graduate students attend joint classes with undergraduates but are assessed separately.",

This course explores the increasing impetus from scientific research and academia, the potential and need for sustainable global development, and why, despite this, international and domestic climate action is often limited.\u00a0\nAn overview is provided of the fundamentals of climate change science, including the astrophysical, atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial processes that drive and amplify natural climatic variability and anthropogenic climate change.\u00a0\nCurrent and likely future impacts of global warming on ecosystems and human activities are considered, including biodiversity, human health, regional inequality, and vulnerability.\u00a0\nWe explore communication, denialism, ethics, and the roles of academia and scientific research. This culminates in an in-class discussion of climate change with climate deniers.\u00a0\nKey principles of International Relations and examples from the realpolitik of international treaties are used to investigate actual and potential societal response strategies. International and Australian climate policies, key actors, and international processes are analysed to assess actual and potential unilateral, private, and collective action. The culmination of the course is a mock treaty negotiation for \"The Canberra Agreement\" under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\u00a0\nContributors to the course include experts from across the ANU and representatives of various government departments, industry, business, and community groups, and research organisations.\n\nNote: Graduate students attend joint classes with undergraduates but have separate seminars and are assessed separately.\nPlease direct all enquiries and correspondence to envs3020-convener@anu.edu.au",

This course investigates the use of broadly applicable ecological principles and methods to restore or sustainably manage woodland and forest ecosystems.\u00a0We begin with how desirable objectives for sustainable ecosystem management can be defined, particularly focusing on criteria and indicators, the adaptive management cycle and a precautionary approach. A range of examples including traditional silvicultural and other systems is used to explore how plant community structures and dynamics can be manipulated to achieve management objectives.\n\u00a0\nThe course uses a \u201chands-on\u201d approach to develop skills in the quantitative assessment, measurement and modelling techniques that are fundamental to assessing the state of an ecosystem. Field exercises are designed to provide experience in assessing whether applied management approaches are leading to the desired changes in system structure and dynamics. The field and applied focus of the course provides experience with the basic quantitative skills that are sought by employers of natural resource management and ecology graduates in areas ranging from hands-on management to policy. Students\u00a0apply their learning to a management planning task within the major assignment, and deliver the results of their work in a conference-style setting at the end of the semester. Smaller quizzes and reports throughout the course help develop skills to assess and interpret forest and woodland structures and conditions, and to develop solutions for multiple management objectives.\n\u00a0\nStudents may expect to interact with researchers and other professionals from the Fenner School of Environment and Society, Forests NSW, Greening Australia, and the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency.\n\nThis course is co-taught with undergraduate students but assessed separately.",

The course focuses particularly on Australia\u2019s public environmental policy and institutional settings. Comparisons with international case studies will be made. Interactive lectures and seminars provide students with opportunities to analyse specific environmental policy issues in theoretical frameworks and over different time scales. Once a general overview of how environmental policy is created we apply a structured analytical tool to assess whether existing environmental policies in Australia are adequate to meet the challenges of environmental management in a changing climate. Topics explored include water, forestry, biodiversity and climate policy, sustainability in business and industry, public and civil society participation in policy-making, and comparisons will be made with overseas environmental policy examples.\n\nThis course is offered as an intensive over 2 weeks.

In essence, palaeoecology enables us to venture back in time and reconstruct landscapes of the past, with much of our understanding of these deep time environmental histories based on the microscopic fossil remains of plants and animals found in sedimentary sequences. There is a rich body of this kind of evidence from around the world and Australia is a fascinating part of the global story.\u00a0\u00a0\nParticipants are introduced to the science of reconstructing past environments through a hands-on research project designed around an environmental research question. Students explore the classic methods and techniques used to understand deep time environmental change through the collection of sedimentary sequences and the laboratory analysis of a number of palaeoenvironmental indicators, such as pollen and charcoal. These two proxy data types reveal what was growing in the landscape at different times in the past and how often it burnt.\n\u00a0\nThe course provides students with an understanding of the intersection between palaeoecology, fire ecology, archaeology, palaeoclimatology and conservation management research. The program also explores how Indigenous people have tended country and altered environmental processes over the millennia, ultimately creating cultural landscapes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStudents will also meet and learn from some of ANU\u2019s leading researchers in this field as well as gain insight into ongoing research in the region, as we delve into how palaeoenvironmental science can play a role in understanding current and future environmental and societal challenges.\u00a0\n\nNote: Postgraduate students will participate in classes with undergraduate students but will be assessed separately.",

The UN Sustainable Development Goals articulate ambitions for each of these elements, and progressing towards those ambitions requires that we also address the synergies and tensions between the SDGs. \n\u00a0\nOver the past 50 years, a global network of institutions and initiatives has emerged to catalyse and communicate research, enable and link researchers, in support of agriculture and natural resources-based development to address these global challenges. Australian researchers, policy makers and practitioners have contributed to this network and activities in a variety of ways; the Australian Center for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) has played a central role in many of these. ACIAR\u2019s partnership mode of research for development is acknowledged globally as an exemplar that other seek to emulate.\n\u00a0\nThis course capitalises on ANU researchers\u2019 engagement in ACIAR and related work, the partnerships developed in those activities, and ACIAR\u2019s presence in Canberra and its wider global role, to explore approaches to partnership research for agricultural and natural resource-based development, modes of working in these partnerships, and to develop knowledge and skills relevant to this work. The course draws on ANU and partner researchers, staff of ACIAR and research for development networks and institutions, and case study examples of partnership research for agricultural and natural resource-based development to provide students with both conceptual and contextual knowledge, and opportunities to develop skills and experience grounded in real cases and projects.",

Family farms are restructuring, there is a greater use of technology and stronger vertical integration up and down the supply chain. Alongside this, consumers are becoming more attune to the environmental and social impacts of production processes, requiring industry to respond and demonstrate their sustainability credentials. More broadly, the regulatory and policy context for agriculture is becoming more complex as global, national and local political institutions overlap. This is further complicated by the increasing number of advocacy groups operating in the agri-food sector, and the impact of social media on the pace of media and political cycles. \n\nThis course provides a survey of these trends for those engaged in the agri-food sector and for the newcomer alike. The aim is to provide an understanding of Australian developments set against international trends, and informed by international research across relevant social science disciplines.

The growth of Asian economies has been spectacular in the past 60 years; the advancement of Japan from the 1950s until the beginning of 1990s, the emerging Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan) in the 1980s, and the rapid transformation and growth of China and India since the 1990s. Asian capital markets are quite diverse as they consist of emerging markets at different stages of development as well as mature markets. Therefore, it is not easy to view Asian capital markets through a single lens. However, this course not only introduces students to capital markets in various Asian countries but also attempts at introducing a unified conceptual framework to understand markets in these countries. The framework focuses on institutional environments (such as legal systems) in different countries and their impacts on corporate behaviour. We also present empirical evidence that such a framework might not necessarily explain the recent developments in China and India. Two of the important features in Asian capital markets, which contrast those of capital markets in UK-US, are the roles played by the State and closely tied families, which we will discuss in detail. The globalization of the world economy in the past two decades has affected the developments of Asian capital markets. Although our course may discuss the development of capital markets of individual countries, we will discuss Asian economies in the global context and will explore the increasing weight of Asia in the world economy.",

We cover the static trade-off theory, agency problem, principal-agent model, mechanism design approach of capital structure, and incomplete contracts. In addition, we cover the literature on investment and banking. Lastly, we cover modern empirical methods to test various hypotheses in corporate finance. In particular, we focus on quasi-experimental and structural approaches.\u00a0",

Taking the city as analytical object, the course will be composed of seminars, visits to cultural sites including museums, monuments and ch\u00e2teaux, collaborative workshops and guided walking tours of historically and culturally-significant districts. The course will critique the dominant narratives and myths surrounding the city, studying Paris's reputation as a global capital of art, literature and politics. Yet it will do so while also exploring under-examined and forgotten parts of the city relating to colonial history, revolutionary history, the legacy of slavery and the evolution of the Republic. The analyses undertaken in this course will equip students with the knowledge and language to understand core concepts surrounding French history, culture and identity, studied through the prism of Parisian cultural heritage. It will also allow them to pursue a substantial project on cultural heritage and history that complements their own research interests. Ultimately, the course will provide students not only with an understanding of Paris's past, but a deeper insight into France's complex present and the tools to understand France and French influence in the world into the future.\nStudents will only be permitted to travel upon completion of ANU required documentation, including, where required, the travel to a high risk destination form and the approval of all documentation by the relevant delegate.\nDisclaimer: Applicants are advised that due to circumstances beyond the University's control (for example, specific international security concerns and international health crises) it may not be possible for students to commence or complete this course as advertised, in which case an alternative lesson plan will be arranged to fulfil the course requirements.",

Coupling semiotics with theories of identity, subjectivity, ideology and discourse students will analyse power relationships in popular culture. Students will also become familiar with debates relating to production and consumption.

What are the effects of sexual imagery in mainstream culture? Is sex empowering or disempowering? What do feminist and queer writers think about the current condition? This course explores the \u201csexualisation\u201d of contemporary life starting with the second wave feminist and gay liberation movements of the 1970s onwards. It considers the impact of these early movements on subsequent feminist and queer perspectives and follows their continuing legacies and debates. Some of the topics the course covers include post-feminism, the pornography debates, the rise of raunch culture, issues surrounding consent and sex work, the impact of HIV/AIDS, the emergence of queer and trans identity politics, and the multi-dimensional linkages between race, sex, gender, sexuality and pleasure.",

Students will also learn how health policies and practices have produced distinct outcomes in different regions and periods.\n\nScience and medicine have conquered many diseases over recent centuries. But trade, exploration, colonisation, mass migration, environmental exploitation, industrialisation, war, urbanisation, political ideologies and international relations have exerted greater influence, and these factors continue to shape patterns of sickness and wellness.\n\nPower and authority sit at the heart of the relationship between illness and wellbeing. This course considers that theme by asking: how have different forms of illness and evolving health measures exposed, created and levelled inequalities? Additional questions include: What strategies have been authorized to combat illness in the pursuit of public health? Under what circumstances did health come to be considered a right?",

This course examines the 1960s in a historical perspective in order to raise questions about the longer term significance of the Vietnam War, the War against Poverty, Civil Rights and the counter culture for American society and values. Along the way we can also explore the usefulness of decades as units of historical time and the parallels and contrasts between the experiences of the United States, Britain, France and Australia during these years.",

How should crime be controlled? Does mercy have a place in punishment? Is the state an agent of injustice? Debate over these questions led to new institutions, practices, and concepts, including: the invention of the penitentiary; the abolition of capital punishment; and the rise of eugenics.\u00a0Lectures and readings will focus on key dilemmas that brought crime and justice into question.

Australians overcame 'cultural cringe', took to Australian films, literature and music, reached out to Asia and embraced multiculturalism. They also took to the streets to protest against the Vietnam War, uranium mining and the nuclear threat, and Aboriginal oppression, while demanding legal abortions and gay rights. It was a time of ferment, and radical social and legal reform. Charismatic political leaders galvanised public attention and raised the level of debate. Censorship was challenged, rock music was everywhere, and sex seemed to be too. This course will take a wide view of Australian politics, involvement in and withdrawal from the Vietnam War, and social change. It will consider why these were such decades of change and what we can learn about processes of change and reform, using texts, photographs, music and films from the period. It will introduce students to a range of historiographical interpretation of this key period.",

This course examines the troubled history of attempts to re-establish prosperity and democracy in the postwar period. In Eastern Europe, Communist dictatorships claimed to provide a superior political and economic system. In Western Europe, the strengthening of democracy often took a back seat to the demands of the Cold War, the legacies of totalitarianism, the reluctance to decolonise and the prioritisation of economic growth. Protest and dissent - from students, feminists and terrorists \u2013 marked both East and West. This course examines the origins and contradictions of contemporary European politics and society in order better to understand the trials and tribulations of Europe in the early 21st century.\u00a0",

Against all expectations, the Bolsheviks maintained power and continued to hold it through civil war, rapid industrialization, colossal loss of life to famine and terror, Nazi invasion and the Cold War before the Soviet Empire collapsed in a remarkably bloodless dissolution in 1991. This course traces the rise and fall of the Russian Revolution, from the disintegration of the Tsarist Empire through the revolutionary era and Stalinism to the height of Soviet power after the Second World War and its dissolution in the late twentieth century. What was Communism and how did it triumph in Russia? What was life like before, under and after Stalin, and why did a regime that withstood civil war, invasion and cold war consign itself so meekly to the dustbin of history?",

            "description": "The death of Charlemagne in 814 ushered in a period critical to the formation of medieval Europe. From the ninth to the thirteenth centuries, Europe experienced significant migration of peoples and witnessed the emergence of enduring political, legal, and social institutions.\u00a0At the same time, divisions between and consolidation of religious institutions took place alongside the flourishing of dynamic intellectual and cultural centres, while expanding horizons to the north, south and east of Europe led to both productive and violent exchanges with peoples and places beyond the continental mainland.\nAdopting a Global Middle Ages approach, this course will examine medieval Europe between c. 850 and 1300 from the twin perspectives of cultures and conflicts. To consider the important role these interlinked facets of medieval life played in shaping the European world, this course will explore a range of topics, including Viking raids and Norse settlement in Europe; the spread of Christianity; Angevins and empire; crusades; Mediterranean cultures, including those in Sicily and Al-Andalus; heresies and religious persecution; and Mongol invasions. By assessing cultures and conflicts across Europe in the centuries after the reign of Charlemagne, students will analyse, interpret, and develop arguments about political structures, social systems, and cultural phenomena that shaped medieval Europe and would have a lasting impact on the centuries to come.",

What is the relationship between biography and history, biography and theory, biography and fiction? How do biographical studies incorporate theory? Should historians use different approaches to biography depending on the culture and/or gender of their subjects? How important is the relationship between biographers and their subjects? What special problems face the biographer of living subjects, or subjects in living memory? Through exploring questions such as these, students will develop a critical understanding of the complex issues surrounding the writing of biography.",

Building on an account of foreign and defence policies, we will trace the political, economic, social and cultural connections between imperial, national and international development and change, and the ways in which meanings of the nation, the region and the international sphere have evolved. Areas of attention will include the key contexts of Australia\u2019s relations with the United Kingdom, the United States, the Asia-Pacific region and international and non-government organisations; the role of diplomacy, the press, public opinion, party attitudes, and expert advice; the dynamics of economic change and population mobility; the ambitions of individuals (including expatriates) and the power of interest groups and political movements as reflected in the intersection of national and international issues.",

The course will appeal to students working, or seeking to work, in areas such as documentary making, museum curatorship, oral history, or heritage management as well as to those interested in the burgeoning scholarly debates about how history is practised outside the academic sphere. The course involves analysis of films, exhibitions, broadcasts, re-enactments, and community-based history telling, while engaging with a range of critical and theoretical readings. The course involves site visits to major cultural institutions where we meet curators and other historical practitioners. The assessment requirements for the course provide students with the opportunity to develop and demonstrate practical skills in interviewing and other forms of non-written historical communication and inquiry.",

Key skills and capabilities include being able to situate one's own research within a broader historical field, identify the key 'question' or 'problem' which that project addresses, and communicate historical ideas and interpretations in appropriate styles, genres and modes. Historians now need to be able to engage with a wide range of audiences, to speak publicly about their own research in academic, pedagogical and public contexts, and to translate research into accessible - including digital and online - forms. They also engage with the work of others through various forms of reviewing (books, films, exhibitions and peer review of unpublished research). And they make connections between their own research discoveries and public and policy debate through opinion pieces, essays, expert advice, and media interviews and commentary. This course will offer instructional programs and activities designed to nourish and enhance the professional development of historians in the widest sense.",

            "description": "Digital technologies have infiltrated nearly all aspects of our existence, covering each natural and cultural urge from ordering food, checking our banking details, finding a partner, or paying our taxes. Our interactions with new digital and computational technologies affect how we think of ourselves and our cultural heritage, both individually and collectively; they influence the ways in which we interact socially and politically; and, they affect how we determine public and private spaces in an increasingly connected world. Our digital legacies even outlast our lives, preserving some part of us even once we are gone. Regardless of the level of involvement, we are all living in the digital era.\u00a0This course engages the students to discuss some of the key ways in which the digital has affected our lives, and what it really means. We examine different manifestations of human culture as it occurs online, pulling in examples from social media, the cultural heritage sector, even the Dark Web. We examine the ethical implications for collecting data about people, critique the ways in which information is presented and retrieved online, discuss popular trends and online behaviours, and tackle questions related to some of the less pleasant aspects of online culture. In order to do so, we need a thoughtful, ethical, critical, and interdisciplinary approach to the study and development of technology. Technology should be understood together with, and in the context of, understanding humanity. Understanding the technology alone is not enough, we need to understand how technology and humanity interact.\n\nExamples of topics and methods covered: Crowdsourcing, Social media analysis (social networking, sentiment analysis, etc), AI and ML methods and problems, Gaming and gamification, Linked Data and Knowledge Representation, Tech utopias/dystopias, Privacy and trust online, Ethics, research, data etc",

Technology is also transforming the way that we access and engage with cultural institutions and arts organisations. However, Digital Humanities is more than just using computers for research, it is a highly critical and scholarly field that consciously considers how humanities topics of research and research practices themselves are being transformed in the digital age. This course introduces students to key methodologies and critical theories in digital humanities. Students have the opportunity to learn, trial and evaluate a range of digital methodologies (ranging from digital mapping, data cleaning, 3D modelling, digitisation, metadata and database creation, digital publishing and audience engagement). Students study the ways that digital and computational methods are transforming research in humanities. There is a particular focus on how digital technologies and projects can be used to engage broader society with humanities and cultural sector research (including design for digital audiences, public history and public culture). The course also addresses complex ethical issues around ownership of data, digital repatriation, politics of archives, and the potential for digital activism. The course includes visits to major cultural institutions in Canberra and talks from experts in digital humanities research from across the ANU.\n\nNo specific technical or computational knowledge is assumed, all students will be supported to work with a range of digital methodologies and practices from whatever level they are at. Students will be given access to the Digital Humanities Lab and its specialist equipment and software. Students will be asked to critically evaluate tools and methods, as well as engaging with key readings, issues and debates, and critical theories. Projects and essays developed for this course may form part of Masters Advanced and Honours thesis projects subject to approval from your supervisor and program convener.\n",

This course surveys key conventions and associated operational guidelines alongside questions of cultural politics, human rights, ownership and copyright. It explores the role of the museum and digital technology in safeguarding and curating intangible heritage. It also frames intangible heritage as a valuable concept for rethinking heritage as a cultural process in which the relationship between the tangible and intangible are renegotiated. Students are asked to consider intangible heritage in relation to key concepts including affect, identity, performativity, temporality, place, and memory. In so doing they will develop a sophisticated and well-informed approach to heritage work which considers the intangible alongside the material. In addition to Heritage and Museum Studies, this course may be of interest to student in history, anthropology, digital humanities and the performing arts.",

A high-profile debate has sprung up among academics on aid effectiveness, and this will be used to frame this part of the course. The course will compare the critiques and strategies presented in the \"best-selling\" books by Bill Easterly, Jeff Sachs, and Paul Collier, and the evidence for them.\n\tOther rich country development policies will be covered in less detail. They will include: migration policy; trade policy; intellectual property rights (especially in the context of health); peacekeeping/military intervention; climate change, and other global public goods; global development architecture (the future of the World Bank and IMF).\n\tMethodological issues: The economic methodologies and evidence-bases used in the policy debates around the above issues are diverse and include: cross-country regressions, organizational theory, principal-agent models, game theory, growth and CGE models, public finance, case-studies, and household surveys. While lectures will not primarily be structured around methodological issues, the course will provide students with the opportunity to consider these different approaches, and their strengths and weaknesses in particular settings.\n\t\u00a0",

This course will provide students with skills in two major analytical tools for quantitative evaluation in macroeconomics, particularly monetary policy: vector autoregressive (VAR) and dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. These tools are heavily used in academic literature and policy analysis in central banks and international organisations. Using these methods, students will be able to identify the sources of macroeconomic fluctuations, gauge how structural shocks affect macroeconomic variables dynamically (impulse responses), forecast, and explore optimal policies. The course is technical and students are expected to have a good understanding of statistics and mathematics prior to enrolling.",

Topics covered include optimal asset allocation, capital asset pricing model, arbitrage pricing theory, efficient market hypothesis, and event study. The second is to study the econometric implications of the finance theory for asset returns and to review a variety of empirical applications.\nThe theoretical part of this course focuses mainly on the derivation and interpretation of the asset pricing models. The derivation can be very mathematical, so the course puts more emphasis on the interpretation so students can obtain the basic skills for using the models in practice. The empirical part of this course introduces the application of finance theories to real data then discusses econometric methodology to test these theories. In addition, students will be required to conduct several computer exercises for some of the empirical applications using the real data and econometric applications such as Excel and EViews.",

The emphasis is on the essential ideas and the applications of econometric methods rather than on technical and theoretical details. However the results are not just presented but instead are derived using a mixture of rigour and intuition so as to leave as few loose ends as possible. We recognise that available economic data are either cross sectional (observations on several economic units - usually countries, firms or households - at a single point in time) or time series (observations one economic unit over time), or panel (observations on several economic units followed through time), and each type of data may need its special set of tools. We start with the linear regression model, which is the simplest model for explaining one variable using several explanatory variables, and then move to an introduction to \u2018micro-econometrics', i.e., methods most useful for the analysis of cross sectional data, and an introduction to \u2018macro-econometrics', i.e., methods most useful for the analysis of aggregate data over time.",

China's domestic economic reforms and growing integration into the global economy have raised countless questions about the nature of China's economic growth and development process in the past, present and future:\u00a0Has China's transition from central planning to an increasingly market-based economy been successful? What kind of capitalist system is China becoming, if becoming capitalist at all? What are the major challenges facing the current generation of leaders under President Xi Jinping, and what are the prospects for economic growth in the future? How has China been transformed by, and in turn transformed, the global economy and how are other nations responding to these twin transformations?\n\nThis course will provide students with the knowledge and skills to address these questions and more through a series of lectures and tutorials that begin with China under Mao, before exploring the major features of the reform period, from gradual experimentalism to unbalanced export-led growth. The course will then focus on the key challenges facing China today, including demographic change and an ageing population, income inequality, pollution and the need for low-carbon green growth, US-China relations and the Australia-China economic relationship.",

This course is a crucial opportunity to learn about several economic planning tools to analyse the benefits and impacts of development and environmental programs typically implemented in developing economies, to understand whether or not these programs are able to achieve the dual objective of economic development and preserving the environment.",

While a person's socioeconomic status (income, employment and education) is likely to be a component of their wellbeing, a person's interaction with the natural, man-made and social environment as well as their physical, mental and emotional health are also vital components. Because of unique cultural and historical factors, Indigenous notions of wellbeing can be somewhat different to those of the rest of the Australian population. Language and cultural maintenance in the face of pressures from the dominant culture are important aspects of wellbeing for many Indigenous Australians. Kinship obligations and attachment to country also tend to be much stronger. Ultimately, an Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian with given levels of material and socioeconomic status may report quite different levels of wellbeing.\nThe aim of this course is to summarise and discuss the existing research on the economic, social and political determinants of Indigenous wellbeing, as well as the demographic context of the population. Students will be exposed to a range of theoretical frameworks within the social sciences that touch on or have insight for Indigenous wellbeing and Indigenous population change. Students will also be guided through a critical discussion of the quantitative and qualitative evidence that has formed our current understanding of wellbeing and the Indigenous population.

Prior to travelling to the University of Arizona students will plan a small research project to be undertaken while they are there. \u00a0The project will require them \u00a0investigate a specific aspect of Native American Indigenous Studies including areas of professional research practice ( for example students may explore: research project management, budgeting and communication; Indigenous Studies research methodologies; industry applications in areas of evidence-based policy formulation; tribal government practice; collaborative research partnerships with Indigenous nations; \u00a0or an applied research topic).\u00a0\nBefore departure, students will undertake a relevant literature search and \u00a0prepare a scope of research terms of reference with their ANU supervisor which they can complete within a four week time frame. This may include participation in an international Indigenous Studies workshop, a conference, or intensive 'summer school' program convened at University of Arizona. While at the University of Arizona they will be assigned a supervisor who will guide them in their research. It may include delivering a research presentation there. On \u00a0return to ANU, students will present for assessment a written report detailing their findings, reflecting on any comparative insights and potential applications of research best-practice they observe between the international situation of Indigenous people they have studied and the Australian context. This may also include delivering a verbal presentation.",

How the balancing of these might vary, both over time and geographically, is discussed. The roles of specialist knowledge, evidence, ideology and morality in the Indigenous policy arena are also discussed, while introducing a \u2018three accounts\u2019 approach to policy and governance. The course then examines a number of policy sectors which are central to recent debates in the Indigenous policy arena. These may change over time but could include: income support, alcohol, child protection, health, housing, land and education. Different sectors are used to think about various aspects and patterns of Indigenous policy processes, such as relations between Indigenous\u2013specific and general policy mechanisms, the changing balancing of competing principles and the differential involvement in various sectors of the levels of Australian government.\u00a0Recent experiments in \u2018mainstreaming\u2019 and whole-of-government policy will also be explored, both for their strengths and limitations. Finally we look at the ideas of failure and success in Australian Indigenous policy and how they relate to rhetorical registers and generational dynamics.",

            "description": "The Responsibility to Protect (R2P) concept has emerged in recent years to take a central place in international deliberations about how to best ensure the protection of populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. While the concept was unanimously endorsed by states at the UN World Summit in 2005, it has not always been consistently implemented and populations continue to suffer from atrocity crimes in various parts of the world. This course seeks a deep understanding of the R2P concept, critically examining questions about the history, ethics, law, and politics of R2P and studying key cases of the threat or perpetration of mass atrocities from the last decade. It reaches beyond well-known debates about military intervention to grapple with the complexities of non-coercive as well as coercive means of protecting populations.",

These approaches inform theoretical and policy debates in terms of different levels or scales of analysis from individuals, states and regional institutions as well as globally. In doing so, the course explores a range of understandings of regional affairs, both traditional and non-traditional, and interrogates underlying motives and competing visions for achieving international order, peace and security in the region. Students will take part within a broader project of theorising international relations from the Asia-Pacific by learning historical and contemporary debates, identifying challenges, and deliberating on policy implications. Through the course, students will gain a nuanced understanding of the diversity that defines the region, its sub-regions and specific comparative country case studies, and why this diversity matters for security.",

The course also looks at the architecture of global security governance, including alliances, international organisations, international regimes and international law. In particular, students will examine how actors seek to regulate global security issues, such as WMDs and international conflict. The course also looks into new global security challenges such as the revolution in military affairs and the transformation of war, the privatisation of security, the rise of jihadi terrorism, and non-traditional security challenges such as environmental security.",

We begin with a study of the bases of sovereignty claims made by modern, territorially based states and the way in which this model of legitimate political authority was globalised during the course of the twentieth century. We then turn to an investigation of the way in which such sovereignty claims work to legitimate particular forms of authority, both domestically and internationally; the relationship between such claims and the politics of identity and, in turn, the construction of the boundaries of states as both moral and physical boundaries. We will then consider the contradictions in the system through investigation of a number of issue areas in which we focus on the vulnerabilities inherent in movement within a system predicated on state authority. These include forced displacement resulting in the creation of refugees and internal displaced persons; labour migration, including the feminisation of such migration; people smuggling and trafficking; and the securitisation of migration, particularly in Western states.",

Debate on the role of humanitarianism in world politics often vacillates between belief in its capacity to transform the international system and frustration and disillusionment with its perceived failure to do so. In examining the role of humanitarianism in world politics, this course seeks to disaggregate these debates, revealing key themes, trends and questions in the evolution of the concepts and practices of humanitarianism. Central amongst these are the themes of assistance and protection that are often viewed as at the very heart of humanitarianism, along with advocacy and evidence. In doing this, the course looks at the historical evolution and global diffusion of humanitarian concepts and practices, the concepts and practices of both international humanitarian assistance and humanitarian intervention, and finally the extent to which conceptions of humanitarian obligations have come to underpin state building projects.",

This course examines how Japan has approached international affairs, from the 19th century until the present. It covers both the domestic and international dimensions of Japanese policymaking, focusing on how different political forces and questions of identity have shaped the evolution of the country's foreign and security policy practices. Key areas of study include: the historical emergence of Japanese strategic thinking; the establishment of the so-called Yoshida Doctrine and the country's alliance with the US during the Cold War; its relationship with other nations in Northeast Asia; and the security reforms enacted at different stages over the post\u2013Cold War period.",

Drawing on multiple feminist traditions and interdisciplinary approaches to peace and security, the course exposes students to the ways in which gender plays a pivotal role in shaping the material and ideological drivers of wars and conflicts, as well as the distribution of resources and responsibilities during times of violence and in their aftermath. Students will gain insights to women\u2019s varied roles in both the perpetration of violence, and in peace building across clans and kinship networks, communities and through nation-building. Students will also grapple with the relevance of de-centering gender analytically and instead examine gender as it intersects with race/ethnicity, citizenship, class, religion, and sexuality in the analysis of the distinct challenges for peace and security in South and Southeast Asia. Finally, the course explores the significance of global and regional security and human rights agendas in enabling the pursuit of justice for women in South and Southeast Asia.",

This unit examines human security as a concept, as an alternative security agenda, and as a guideline for policy and institutional initiatives.

We will begin by considering leftist and revolutionary radicalisms, including radical Marxisms, anarchisms, and revolutionary ideas in the anticolonial tradition. In the second half of the course, we will consider conservative and reactionary international thought. The course readings will draw on theoretical works in these traditions, along with relevant secondary literature and linkages to research in IR and international history.",

To correct for this, cutting edge work in the field has started to develop tools to confront some of the most pressing global issues: for instance conflict, atrocity, increasing inequality, migration, displacement, and climate change. This course sets out a series of frameworks with which to understand and act upon these issues, as well as examining arguments about the key actors in international ethics and analysing the logics of various responses to ethical problems. The course explores the relationships between theory and practice and between ethics and politics, and is structured around both close examination of the academic literature and application to \u2018real world\u2019 situations and cases.",

The course investigates first why states are interested in regional governance, the different forms of regionalism that can come about and how we can think about what success and failure of regionalism looks like. From there it turns to the study of ASEAN in Southeast Asia, examining the reasons for its creation, how it has grown over time and how this growth can be understood theoretically. Each week pairs together conceptual arguments about how and why something happens with the empirical case of Southeast Asia, exemplifying the importance of the region for both applying and building our frameworks of analysis.

This course will focus on personal injuries and examine the torts of trespass to the person and negligence. The course will also consider ways in which interests in property can be protected, namely through the tort of trespass to land. Historically the law of torts was largely based on common law (developed through judicial decisions), but legislative reforms in the last decade have made significant changes to the common law.",

In this course we look at the evolution of contract, its central role in a market economy and the criteria for making legally enforceable promissory obligations. The requirements for the formation of a binding contract are examined together with the content of agreements. This involves an examination of the associated rules and doctrines used to ascertain the meaning and scope of the obligations expressly or impliedly undertaken by the parties to a contract. \u00a0We will also be looking at breach of contract and its consequences, including a consideration of the remedies available at common law and in equity. The law of contract is affected and influenced by a range of other legal doctrines and statutory measures, notably the doctrines of estoppel, duress, undue influence and unconscionable conduct and the statutory prohibition on misleading or deceptive conduct. Throughout the course we consider the foundational rules and doctrines of contract law and the effect on contract law of these other areas of law. \u00a0Contract law is an important foundation for other compulsory and elective courses taken later in the degree including Property and Commercial Law.\u00a0",

            "description": "This course in Australian Public Law reflects the distinctive vision of the ANU JD program in which the study of Australian Public Law is a compulsory part. It also reflects the particular emphasis that the ANU College of Law gives to the study and research of Australian Public Law, which ultimately is reflected in the research of the ANU College of Law and in organisations such as the Centre for International and Public Law. The study of Australian Public Law at a relatively early stage in JD studies will open a pathway into a range of additional law courses and opportunities, and to thinking about opportunities beyond the JD too. To that end, LAWS 6105 has a strong focus on foundational aspects of the discipline of Australian Public Law.Australian Public Law deals with many aspects of the functioning of the key constitutional institutions of government at the national, state, and territory levels, and how those institutions interact with one another and with the Australian people. The wide-ranging impact of Australian Public Law on the Australian legal system and on Australian\u00a0 governmental, judicial and social activities means that a basic knowledge of the terminology, institutions, and substance of Australian Public Law is not only worthwhile acquiring in its own right, but is also a necessary part of the knowledge and skills of any law graduate, and of any citizen of a democratic society. This makes Australian Public Law of considerable interest, whether you choose to go into the private practice of law, to work as a government or public lawyer, or are undertaking a law degree because you consider it will be useful in another career. This JD course in Australian Public Law is designed to provide you with an understanding of the core essentials of this area of law, and to provide you with the foundations for further reflection on, and study of, topics in this area.\u00a0",

Administrative law concerns the legal rules and institutions which seek to keep the \u2018governors\u2019 in society (principally, decision-makers in the executive arm of government) accountable. It encompasses both judicial and non-judicial modes of accountability (eg administrative tribunals, the ombudsman, and legislation providing for access to information and limiting the purposes for which government can use information). Administrative law can be conceptualised as the legal regulation of the exercise of public (as opposed to \u2018private\u2019) power. More specifically, this course will consider:\nDifferent ways to think about the reach of administrative law in the context of the changing nature of contemporary governance;The function and scope of judicial review of administrative action, with particular attention to the constitutional, statutory and common law sources of judicial review jurisdiction.Many of the important legal principles associated with the availability of judicial review remedies, the grounds on which administrative decisions may be judicially reviewed, and \u2018standing\u2019 to bring judicial review actions;Statutory attempts by Parliaments to restrict judicial review and the extent to which judicial review is constitutionally entrenched;The concept of merit review, with particular attention to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal;The role played by non-adjudicative accountability mechanism with particular attention to the operation of public sector Ombudsman and Freedom of Information legislation;The role played by administrative law in the context of important constitutional principles such as the separation of powers and the rule of law;The historical and social context in which Australian administrative law has developed.\n\u00a0",

            "description": "Evidence law governs the use of proof in legal proceedings and answers important questions like: How much proof is enough? What will the jury be allowed to hear? And what kinds of proof can be used? Evidence law is also a major component of trial procedure, governing how proof is presented in a trial. The law of evidence regulates the emergence of the parties\u2019 narratives; and decisions about evidentiary issues frequently determine which version of events is believed, what is considered \u2018fact\u2019 and what is not. Liberty, property, livelihoods and families can hang in the balance.Understanding the law of evidence is integral to understanding the trial process and the development of all areas of substantive law. Evidence law is the lens through which the legal system views the \u201cfacts\u201d of a case. Understanding how a record of evidence is developed will give you new insight into litigation processes and appellate decisions. It will also give you a new perspective on the adversarial system and the importance of advocacy. If you become a litigator or barrister someday, evidence law will be your bread and butter. If you never become a litigator, you will need to know evidence law in order to make appropriate decisions for clients who are not in litigation. Protecting your clients\u2019 rights outside litigation may depend on your knowledge about what might be admissible if litigation were eventually employed. Even if you leave law and go into business or another field, understanding evidence will give you a new perspective on the nightly news.This course is an introduction to the law of evidence. It covers important aspects of proof, admissibility, fact-finding, and the standards and procedures that are applied in legal proceedings. While it would be possible (and fascinating) to take a philosophical approach to evidence issues, this course takes a practical approach. It will require you to participate in discussion, present arguments, think on your feet, and make strategic decisions. You should leave the course with fluency in Uniform Evidence Law and with a strong understanding of the principles that undergird the rules of evidence and trial procedure in common law systems. \u00a0\u00a0",

The course is compulsory for both the LLB and the JD and its successful completion is required by the Supreme Court if a student seeks to be admitted as a barrister or solicitor.This course not only explains how cases get to a court hearing and what the court expects the parties to do to prepare the matter for hearing, it also examines how disputation is processed en route and looks at the broader policy questions which underpin the design of the justice system.This course is taught late in the LLB/JD degrees and it is taught with the expectation that you have a good understanding of earlier substantive law courses such as Tort and Contract. It is possible to undertake the Property and Corporations Law courses alongside this course but you should stay up to speed in those courses otherwise you will get lost in this course. This course is complementary with the Evidence course as the two areas of knowledge are dealt with together in practice. Often the procedures dealt with in this course will provide a gateway to aspects of your studies in Evidence. However Evidence and LDM are independent courses; the order in which you do them is unimportant.\u00a0",

Within legal philosophy, analytic jurisprudence applies the rigour of analytic philosophy to the study of the concept of law. This course will focus on the canonical works in analytic jurisprudence. The course revolves around one simple question: \u201cWhat is law?\u201d",

The field of International Law deals with many aspects of the functioning of the international community (including the treatment by States with each other and with international organisations); it also affects many activities that occur within or across State boundaries (including the treatment by States of their citizens, environmental law, military operations, and many other areas). The impact of international law on the Australian legal system and the globalised nature of many governmental judicial and social activities means that a basic knowledge of the terminology, institutions, and substance of international law is not only worthwhile acquiring in its own right, but is also a necessary part of the knowledge and skills of any law graduate.",

The AMC is the Australian Capital Territory's only adult prison, accommodating all persons who have been sentenced to full-time imprisonment or remanded in custody by ACT Courts.\nThe Prison Legal Literacy Clinic was developed from the highly successful ANU College of Law, Law Reform and Social Justice Prison Legal Literacy Program which commenced in 2010.\u00a0\nStudents in the Prison Legal Literacy Clinic will attend the AMC to deliver six legal literacy sessions for a cohort of detainees chosen by AMC management. These sessions provide legal information only, rather than legal advice. The first session focuses on establishing mutually agreed rules and boundaries, developing respectful relationships and identifying areas of legal interest to detainees that will become the topics for the remaining five sessions. These topics are as diverse as detainees interests but may involve laws and legal process relating to criminal law, evidence, sentencing, appeals, parole, administrative law, human rights law and tort law. Many topics require students to convey an understanding of the democratic process of law making, the federal system of law as well as the hierarchy and jurisdiction of courts and tribunals.\u00a0The emphasis is on students working as a team to develop informative, engaging and interactive sessions. Student are required to undertake significant research in each week of the session delivery phase of the course, often in areas of law that are unfamiliar to them. Detainees who complete the program are presented with a certificate in the final session acknowledge their efforts.\nStudents will be provided with Security Awareness Training by the AMC and supported before and during the delivery stage of the program by the course convenor who will be present at, and guide the delivery of, each of the Legal Literacy Sessions at the AMC.\nFollowing the delivery of six sessions (in the first 6 weeks of the semester) students are required to submit a reflective assessment. Students will then use the remaining six weeks of the semester to write a research paper on a legal topic they have identified from their experience with detainees within the AMC. Students will be supported to develop and hone their research papers in research workshops that will be held in the second half of the semester.\n\nStudents must apply to undertake this course.

Central to the course is the examination of the adequacy of the current state of Australian legal education, legal practice, law and justice in relation to First Nations peoples, with a view to possibilities for reform.\nThe course acknowledges the multidimensional roles of law and explores connections between law, culture and identity and between law, legitimacy and resources. Additional issues include the roles of legal education, legal practice and the legal system concerning how lawfulness and justice are constructed and performed. The course incorporates consideration of substantive areas of law such as legal ethics, property, criminal and civil law.\nThe course presents principles and tools to support reappraisal and future leadership to better address legal and societal dimensions of justice, rights and empowerment for First Nations peoples.\nThe course covers issues relating to Indigenous world views, historical and contemporary Indigenous experiences of settler-colonialism, the phenomena of legacy relationships and legacy systems, and concepts of cultural safety and decolonisation. Students will critically assess the implications of issues for themselves, relating to Indigenous peoples, and relating to the future of law and justice in Australia. As such, the course builds on concepts introduced in Lawyers, Justice and Ethics, Australian Public Law, International Law and Property Law.\nStudents will complete orientation workshops (max 6 hours) prior to departure, complete the on country intensive (5 days), and submit reflective assessments. Students will have six weeks after completing the intensive to write a research paper on an aspect of decolonising legal education, legal practice, law and justice in Australia and present their findings.\n\nStudents must apply to undertake this course.

However,\nbarriers to justice include extreme disadvantage, gross under-resourcing of non-profit legal services in the region and enormous lacks relating to law and justice across the\ncultural interface.\n\nIn this course student learning is driven by involvement in law in action justice work. The course is structured around students undertaking paralegal work at the KCLS\nAboriginal Justice Clinic at the Law School. The clinic is incorporated real-time in the KCLS legal practice and students are supervised by KCLS lawyers. This is an immersive\nand challenging context for guided exploration about how law has been instrumentalized in relation to First Nations peoples, and the impacts. Also, whether and how laws,\nlegal institutions and legal practice can become forces for empowerment.\n\nThe course includes consideration of substantive areas of law, public policy, and critical Indigenous legal theories and presents principles and concepts which are pressed by\nFirst Nations peoples in pursuit of justice, rights and empowerment. The course emphasises the voices, lived experiences and authority of Aboriginal people of the Kimberley\nand engages and supports students in exploring how theory works in step with practice and reflection.\n\nAccordingly, students will complete a workshop program which incorporates familiarization with KCLS and the Hotdesk, key skills, self-care, cultural protocols, and the\nconcepts of reflection, reflexivity, settler-colonialism, epistemic injustice and approaches to empowerment. Students also complete a minimum of 10 x 1 day (7 hour)\nparalegal sessions at the KCLS-ANU Hotdesk and assessments consisting of reflective case studies which critically explore readings and themes in the course, and a\nresearch paper related to themes in the course.",

It puts them in a broader international context through an examination of anti-corruption laws and enforcement regimes in Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom.\nThe course studies the implications of corruption and anti-corruption measures for public policy and corporate compliance, especially in the context of international business. A variety of approaches to tackling corruption are considered. This includes both preventive measures, such as governance standards in the public and private sector, and enforcement measures, such as the criminalisation of corruption, anti-money laundering measures, the recovery of the proceeds of corruption and the use of targeted sanctions.",

But what are the rules that regulate this most terrifying of weapons?\n\u00a0\nThis course will take students logically through the diverse elements of the applicable law showing how that law can make sense in the extreme circumstances of nuclear war.\u00a0After examining ideas of sovereignty and jurisdiction, we will consider the law as it applies respectively to the resort to the use of nuclear force and to the conduct of nuclear operations during an armed conflict.\u00a0International crimes, neutrality and national doctrine will be addressed and the continued relevance, or otherwise, of a pivotal opinion of the International Court of Justice, dating from the mid-1990s, will be assessed.\u00a0We will review the significance of a treaty, adopted a few years ago, that would ban nuclear weapons and in a concluding session, we will try to draw conclusions for the future of NC3.\n\u00a0\nThe course is structured into ten lectures, taking a distinct topic within each lecture.\u00a0In the associated seminars, course members will work through practical problems in sub-groups thereafter presenting and discussing their proposed solutions in the plenary setting.\u00a0Some background understanding of international law as it affects conflict would be a desirable advantage, but the course can and will be taught on the basis of no prior knowledge.\n\u00a0\nThe intended learning outcomes include the ability to think, discuss and formulate solutions at the strategic level, an understanding of the challenges posed by the peculiar characteristics of nuclear weapons, an appreciation of the legal and political realities that influence national nuclear policies and a recognition of the global issues that arise when addressing a weapon the very existence of which arouses such widespread concern.  \n\nStudents undertaking this course can expect to see the challenges posed by nuclear weapons in a sharper light than hitherto.",

Correspondingly, other than constitutional interpretation, there are two main modes of legal reasoning: statutory interpretation and common law reasoning. Common law reasoning is, in many ways, more fundamental than statutory interpretation. In contrast to the civil law legal system, we call our system a common law legal system. Common law reasoning is foundational to our legal system. Besides a common law approach to case law, we also speak of a common law approach to constitutional interpretation and a common law approach to statutory interpretation. Common law reasoning permeates all areas of law in our legal system. The course will cover the following topics: history and theory of the common law; the doctrine of stare decisis; separating ratio from obiter; deductive and inductive reasoning; reasoning by analogy and disanalogy.

This course examines the legal issues underlying the \"Lex Automagica\" tech stack of blockchain, smart contracts, and AI. It provides an overview of each layer of the technology, how they can interact, and an examination of the many legal and policy issues arising from the implementation of the technology. It will examine the many other uses to which blockchain is or may be applied, including the development of so-called smart contracts.

In particular, it will focus on Part IV of the CCA; the Part that prohibits various forms of anticompetitive conduct.\u00a0",

            "description": "The purpose of the course is to examine the far-reaching changes that have occurred since the nineteenth century to the body of law governing recourse to the use of force (jus ad bellum). In 1945 the United Nations Charter prohibited States from resolving their international disputes by the threat or use of force except, subject to certain conditions, in self-defence, and established a system of collective security whereby the Security Council would take action in the name of the international community to maintain or restore international peace and security.The Cold War obstructed the effective realisation of these provisions. As a result of Security Council paralysis and in order to protect perceived essential national interests, some States adopted expansive concepts of self-defence or other justifications for recourse to force of doubtful legality.\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s led to a renewal of hopes that a system of collective security might function as originally intended. Those hopes have not been entirely fulfilled, but the concept of international peace and security has been expanded in the last few decades to embrace violations of human rights, denial of democracy, and urgent humanitarian needs, thus justifying collective action under Security Council mandates.The course will not revisit in any great detail the normative content of self-defence, both individual and collective (in this regard students are encouraged to revise their LAWS8183 Advanced Principles of International Law materials), but will examine other contentious or sometimes overlooked issues: such as implied authorisations and intervention by invitation. More traditional topics, such as the doctrine of humanitarian intervention and the idea of a responsibility to protect (R2P) will also be considered.Topics may include:\n \t\tThe history of the jus ad bellum: from the \"Just War\" theory to the United Nations Charter; \t\tThe scope of the prohibition: can it cover cybercrime? What is a threat? Who are the addressees of the prohibition? \t\tMilitary intervention by invitation; \t\tChapter VII of the United Nations Charter and so called implied 'authorisations' to use force; \t\tThe role of regional arrangements in the use of force; \t\tHumanitarian intervention and the 'Responsibility to Protect'.",

During the course, students will be given opportunities to familiarise themselves with contemporary examples of how international law in different areas regulates the way in which security measures are adopted and undertaken in response to existing and emerging threats.\u00a0",

            "description": "The course is designed to review the ever-changing scope and operation of the executive power inherent in the Australian Constitution. It is set against the background of the UK development of the concept (largely by the courts). But its primary focus is on s 61 of the Constitution and relevant \u00a0decisions of the High Court. It draws also on available literature. \nBecause of the large expansion of executive power in recent years it then moves on to explore current issues. These are associated with powers relating to migration and 'terrorism', the trend towards republicanising the legal system \nThe course content uses an historical, analytical and topical approach to enable the potential of the concept of executive power in Australia to be appreciated and in particular focuses on:\n  the emergence of the concept of an Australian executive power and the consequential progressive reduction in reliance on prerogative power as a useful concept   the conventions and law governing the exercise of executive power (by Governor-General, Ministers, Cabinet and administrators)   the constitutional grounding of responsible government and its effectiveness in the 21st century   the narrowing of the traditional immunities and privileges the common law extends to the Crown and the impact of the practice by the executive of privatising and contracting out   federal issues relating to executive power, including the issues that arise if there is a conflict between the exercise of Commonwealth and State executive power   the unique position of the executive in the ACT   challenges to the protection, through the rule of law, of individuals, using as examples counter-terrorism law and migration law.",

            "description": "This course aims to provide an advanced understanding of how law and regulation relate to current debates about corporate responsibility and business respect for human rights standards. What would constitute an ideal regulatory and remedial framework on the human rights impacts of business activity? What commercial, political or social forces and factors shape these issues in practice?Delivered online, this course analyses the source, nature, content and practical significance of legal, regulatory, self-regulatory and other frameworks governing the ways in which business actors and activities might affect human rights. Framed by an understanding of the position in public international law, the course turns mainly on the significance of the 2011 UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, while addressing the range of regulatory options.From law suits for alleged corporate complicity in apartheid and other grave crimes, to examples of voluntary business leadership on addressing human trafficking, this course combines a commitment to objectivity and conceptual clarity with an emphasis on robust and informed student exchange. Approaching from a legal and regulatory perspective, the course addresses complex, controversial issues such as allegations of rights abuse in global food or manufacturing supply-chains; how global telecoms companies manage customer service in repressive states; and extractive industry stakeholder relations in conflict-affected regions. Through practical case studies students will be exploring the nexus of two of the most profound social and regulatory phenomena of our time: economic globalisation, and the international human rights narrative.The course is of relevance to policymakers, regulators, corporate and financial executives, those in civil society, the media, and the legal profession. Any contemporary study of international relations or international law is incomplete without going beyond states to consider the influence of transnational business and investment actors. Likewise, the private sector operates in a public world so that business scholars must factor in the increasing salience of corporate responsibility and accountability issues. Meanwhile, governmental actors are not the only source of human rights promotion: what positive role exists for the private sector?\u00a0The course emphasises transnational commercial networks and regulatory responses, but makes some reference to Australian scenarios. Through moderated discussions and with occasional guest expert input, students navigate some key issues. How can business activity affect the enjoyment of human rights? How effective are existing regulatory responses, and what undermines these? What is the role for business self-regulation, and what is the state\u2019s duty to control the social impacts of a business operating abroad? What avenues of remedy exist or could or should exist? Should we pursue a binding treaty in this field, how likely is this, and what would it include? What particular responsibilities accompany investment decisions in repressive or conflict-affected states?\u00a0",

This has especially been reflected in numerous Security Council Resolutions mandating naval operations, and more generally military operations to maintain international peace and security. UN-mandated naval operations were especially significant in the sanctions regime imposed against Iraq (1990-2003) during which time extensive state practice developed in this field. Since then the Security Council has also mandated member states to conduct military operations at sea to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, international terrorism, and piracy.Some of the recent developments that have taken place in response to piracy off the coast of Somalia have been the most significant in the past century. These events have shone the spotlight back on maritime security and have emphasised the importance of this distinctive branch of international law.",

Indeed, since the signing of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1968, tremendous energies have been expended upon diplomatic efforts to develop an institutionalised framework to regulate the production and use of single and dual-use nuclear materials within states, as well as their spread through the increasingly globalised channels of international trade to other states and non-state actors. This course provides an advanced understanding of how international law and organisations regulate both peaceful and military nuclear activities within and across states, in order to facilitate the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, while limiting the use of nuclear materials for military purposes, and securing fissile materials from theft and diversion to private actors. It will also cover counter-proliferation efforts, up to and including the international use of force, and international legal sources relevant to such efforts.",

            "description": "National Security Law is a rapidly evolving field of concern for Government, security agencies, civil rights monitors, and the Australian public. As both the nature of threats (represented by, for example, the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, or the rise of cyber security as a major national security concern) and the concept of \u2018security\u2019 (such as biosecurity) have evolved, legal responses have similarly evolved.\u00a0\nAs new incidents occur or challenges arise, it is often the case that legislative change is one of, if not the, preferred initial response. These changes have been broadly cast - ranging from expanded or refined operating powers and processes for national security agencies, through to the creation of new offences within the widening penumbra of criminalised conduct that surrounds demonstrably terrorist activity.\nThis course offers a broad brush across a number of issues concerning national security law. The course will commence with a series of building blocks (heads of power, conceptions of security, historical background). This will then allow more detailed exploration of a series of institutional issues (such as the legislative arrangements for important national security institutions, and the \u2018security law\u2019 making and monitoring process), practical issues (such as use of force, and use of classified information in prosecutions), and thematic issues (such as the national security \u2013 civil rights balancing debate).",

            "description": "Gender issues, particularly in relation to women\u2019s status and rights, occupy a prominent place in debates about aid and development. Law is often perceived to play a crucial role in shaping men\u2019s and women\u2019s social, economic and political opportunities, but also in the ways we conceive of gender in the first place (including the binary construction \u2018men/women\u2019). \nThis course explores the relationship between gender, law and development in historical and comparative perspective. It introduces a range of conceptual frameworks, which are explored through an examination of prominent aid and development issues, such as:\u00a0\nRights to land; natural resources;Climate change;Employment and labour;Food production, distribution and consumption.\nThese thematic areas provide an opportunity for students to critically examine the presumed and actual relationship between international and domestic legal frameworks and gender inequality, as well as consider debates about the role and recognition of customary laws and institutions. Particular attention will be paid to the insights of postcolonial feminists and critical race theorists and the work of women of colour. The course will also centre questions of conflict and ideological diversity when it comes to gender, law and development and encourage the students to think critically about these three concepts and their intersection. \nThis unit draws on the extensive scholarly and applied expertise in gender and development at the ANU and is designed to encourage student engagement and participation.\u00a0",

            "description": "This course considers international labour law from its origins to the 21st century challenges of decent work, as promoted in Sustainable Development Goal 8.\u00a0\nThe world of work has changed and continues to evolve. Today commentators ask: what is the future of work? And given the imbalance of power among States, corporations, communities and individuals; the decline of unions; and the weakness of civil society organizations and marginalised groups, one might ask why bother with international labour law? In this course students will be encouraged to think about these issues and, having established a solid understanding of the international rules and principles governing labour and work, will be invited to reflect critically on both the thinking and practice bearing on international labour law, including its relevance and effectiveness.\nThe course will focus on the breadth of world-of-work issues, an understanding of the impact (strengths and weaknesses) of the international rules and principles that address these issues, and critical appraisal of real case examples where international labour law has improved the lives of working women and men, and contributed to improved social and economic outcomes. It will deliver knowledge and hone skills regarding the fundamental substantive areas (echoing but not duplicating existing ANU courses on, for example, maritime law, migration, indigenous rights, health/OSH and social security). It will address process issues including who can and how do States and organizations lodge complaints of violations of international labour law, the methods used in monist and dualist States, remedies available, and how to track the impact of international labour law from the practical point of view.\nThe course will cover:\na. Definition, scope, origins and objectives of international labour law;\nb. Role of the ILO: mandate, tripartite composition, structures, standard-setting, regular supervisory system (Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations & Conference Committee on Labour Standards), complaints mechanisms (Committee on Freedom of Association; commissions of inquiry), successes (social protection, domestic workers\u2019 rights) and shortcomings (the recent attacks on the right to strike, dismissal law & indigenous rights at work);\nc. Relationship between ILO and UN treaty bodies (in particular the Committees on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), on the Rights of Child (CRC) and the CEDAW Committee as well as ECOSOC\u2019s functional commissions (Statistical Commission and its work on indicators for decent work within the 230 SDG indicators, Commission on the Status of Women\u2019s specific references to gender equality at work), and other multilateral institutions relevant to international labour law (World Trade Organization\u2019s Ministerial Declarations on labour standards, G20 2015 Heads of State Outcome Document);\nd. The four fundamental international labour standards (freedom of association-based on Conventions 87 & 98, non-discrimination-based on Conventions 100 & 111, forced labour-based on Conventions 29 and its Protocol & 105, child labour-Conventions 138 & 182) and related technical international labour law;\ne. Interface between international labour law and social and economic development highlighting the role of international legal principles generally in the face of modern-day inequalities;\nf. New areas of international labour law (including GBV at work, social protection reforms, labour rights of marginalised groups) and revamped mechanisms for implementing international labour law (possible UN treaty on business and human rights, including labour rights).",

            "description": "While originally coined in 2006 by Tarana Burke, a social activist and community organiser, the #MeToo movement moved into the spotlight in 2017 when several female celebrities\u00a0accused film mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault. Since then, women (and some men) around the world have shared their experiences with sexual violence\u00a0and harassment across social media and the press using both #metoo and #timesup. These hashtags aimed not just to bring the issues to the collective attention, but to end sexual\u00a0violence and discrimination in all their forms by breaking the silence around gender-based violence and promoting social change.\n\nBeyond giving survivors a platform to discuss their experiences, these movements also raised important legal issues. For example, #metoo raised issues around spoliation, statutes\u00a0of limitation, due process, wrongful termination, libel, non-disclosure agreements, backlogs of evidence, and sexual harassment and abuse in legal workplaces, amongst other\u00a0issues. Changes occurred as a result of the movement, but at the same time back-steps happened in some jurisdictions as a backlash was felt.\n\nIn this module, we discuss the issues #metoo raised for the criminal justice system and civil courts, while considering the broader socio-legal interface to explore potential further\u00a0points for improving equality and addressing inequity for those experiencing sexual violence and harassment, including in the legal profession itself. The module brings experts from\u00a0their respective issues to ask: What did #metoo highlight? What legal changes did it initiate? What work is there still to be done?\n\nStudents will begin by considering the theoretical underpinnings of the movement, exploring violence, intersectionality, marginalisation and access to justice. Next, we consider the\u00a0role of social media and the digital age in the momentum #metoo gained, and what legal issues this raises. Then, we move to explore what the movement has highlighted about the\u00a0problems and pitfalls of the criminal law, evidence and procedure for those with claims, both old and new. In the civil realm, we explore issues around contracts, arbitration\u00a0provisions, and non-disclosure agreements, asking what these mean for breaking the silence. Finally, we consider how the legal profession itself has come into focus as a site of\u00a0sexual harassment and abuse, raising issues for courts, law firms and the profession more broadly. In short, students explore how #metoo has made significant and lasting\u00a0difference, but also explore how its impacts have been felt unequally, looking to what can be done moving forward.",

AI powers machine learning, natural language processing, sentiment analysis and complex autonomous systems operating in different domains. Each of these has ramifications for the law and society. The use of algorithmic decision-making and predictive coding by government and in the courts are cause for concern. Future lawyers and other professionals will need to understand the benefits and risks associated with the use of different types of AI in all aspects of social interaction, governance, compliance, risk analysis and business opportunities. The role of AI in social relationships of trust has been explored in science fiction and popular media. Its impact on the markets, elections, global health trends and human relationships is not to be underestimated. Artificial Intelligence, Law, & Society (AILS) is an interdisciplinary module that explores these questions and helps students understand the societal impact of ubiquitous AI, robotics, and automation.

The particular legal risks that students will assess are privacy, cyber, intellectual property, governance and regulation, as well as compliance with respect to occupational health and safety, human rights, climate change, employment law and occupiers liability. The students' risk assessment report will be provided to the start up business whose product or platform they have reviewed.

Whilst it places particular emphasis on the applicable Commonwealth, NSW and ACT law, the course reviews fundamental concepts, useful tools and insights with which to understand and critically analyse environmental law.\n\u00a0Topics covered include:\nintroduction defining the 'environment', 'ecologically sustainable development';the common law and environmental protection;environmental law in a federal system;role of local and state governments;statutory land-use planning and development control law;evironmental impact assessment law;bodiversity law;native vegetation law;pollution control law;a brief introduction to climate change and energy law;environmental litigation;enforcement of environmental law; andmajor projects law.",

            "description": "This course explores how transnational commercial disputes may be resolved in an authoritative, binding legal way without resorting to litigation before a court. Court-related litigation is more familiar to both lawyers and non-lawyers alike, yet captures only a fraction of the activity towards resolving disputes that occurs before consensual arbitration. Much as there has been a focus in domestic law on 'alternative dispute resolution', so in our globalised economy there is a whole institutional architecture for resolving private commercial disputes with a transnational dimension. The availability of such trusted arbitration (and adjudication) forums is central to parties' confidence in contractual arrangements, and so to facilitating transnational commerce in general. The importance of international commercial arbitration to international commerce is a key theme throughout the course.\nThis course will cover topics such as the nature and sources of international arbitration; drafting and enforcing arbitration agreements; arbitral procedures and how domestic (state) courts support the international arbitral process and awards made by arbitrators; the law applicable to the merits in international arbitration; challenging, recognising and enforcing awards; and the role of public policy in international arbitration. It will also reflect on the composition, competency and competition among different major global forums for international commercial arbitration: who are arbitrators, where are they doing this, what trends can be discerned in the non-judicial but binding legal resolution of commercial disputes? \nThe course was designed primarily for intensive delivery, and/or for offshore delivery in cooperation with partners in a major Asia-Pacific arbitration city.",

Central to the course is an examination of the extent to which Australian law recognises the rights and interests of Indigenous Australians as citizens and as peoples. It presents constitutional, human rights and property law relating to Indigenous peoples in their socio-political, historical and cultural contexts, questioning the adequacy of the current state of the law with a view to possibilities for future law reform. It acknowledges the disproportionately large role of the law in the lives of this arguably overly-regulated but under-protected group of peoples, providing an understanding of some of the central legal issues facing Indigenous Australians, and the impact this has and has had on Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. The course covers issues relating to legal definitions of Indigeneity, the relationship between Indigenous Australians and the state, self-determination, racial discrimination, rights to lands and waters, and the place of Indigenous Australians in the world community of Indigenous peoples. As such, it builds on concepts introduced in Australian Public Law, International Law and Property Law.",

The course will be interdisciplinary. The topics and readings will be centred on the theme of the 'Foundations of Law'. The theme bears an allusion to the first-year compulsory course that all law students at the ANU have to take: the 'Foundations of Australian Law'. However, in this elective course, we are interested in a different kind of foundation. We will interrogate not the foundations of any particular legal system, but the foundations of law itself. Whereas the 'Foundations of Australian Law' equips students with the foundational skills of legal reasoning, this elective course invites students to take a step back to consider and interrogate the foundational mythologies of law. We will explore the 'Foundations of Law' through the humanistic disciplines of classics, literature, philosophy and theology: we will read classical plays (e.g. Antigone), contemporary novels (e.g. Lord of the Flies), philosophical works (e.g. Genealogy of Morals), and theological writings (e.g. Genesis and Exodus). These texts present different modes and means of inquiring into the assumptions and aspirations that we ascribe to law.",

            "description": "National Security Law is a burgeoning field of concern for Government, security agencies, civil rights monitors, and the Australian public. As both the nature of threats (represented by, for example, the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, or the rise of cyber security as a major national security concern) and the concept of 'security' (such as biosecurity) have evolved, legal responses have similarly evolved. This course offers a broad brush across a number of issues concerning national security law. The course will commence with a series of building blocks (heads of power, conceptions of security, historical background). This will then allow more detailed exploration of a series of institutional issues (such as the legislative arrangements for important national security institutions, and the 'security law' making and monitoring process), practical issues (such as use of force, and use of classified information in prosecutions), and thematic issues (such as the national security - civil rights balancing debate).",

It examines the how law is connected to contemporary political issues, among others, including those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, environment and economics. This course introduces major concepts, questions and perspectives that are important for a critical engagement with the problem of law in contemporary life. It questions the importance and meaning of being 'critical' and interrogates the relationship between law and justice. By following a set of topics fundamental for critical theory the course eflects on the problems of sovereignty, subjectivity, violence, judgment or the nature of government. By applying these critical legal perspectives to a range of contemporary problems and situations the course will show the relevance of critical theory to contemporary study of law and equip the students with the ability to deal with theoretical questions pertaining to issues such as biotechnology, social media, political protest, interdisciplinarity, human rights, social equality or refugee law. This course will review the thought and concepts of the most important critical figures in Western philosophy including Karl Marx, Antonio Gramsci, Giorgio Agamben, Michel Foucault or Jacques Derrida.",

Those conflicts, which are all too often disruptive of international peace and security, raise serious difficulties for international law.The objective of this course will be to provide a detailed analysis of the international norms applicable in this field (including, but not limited to, self-determination, secession, State succession and recognition); to enquire whether international law can provide satisfactory remedies for those conflicts; and to ask what are, if any, the legal gaps in this field.Beyond its theoretical framework this course will adopt a \u201cpractical\u201d approach by examining a large number of case studies, including current events in Ukraine, Syria, Iraq, Mali, Sudan, Palestine and other places. This will permit participants to learn more about the roots and the outcomes of some important ethno-political conflicts around the world and to find out how international organisations deal with these crises, and the effectiveness of the different strategies used for diffusing violent situations and resolving ethno-political conflicts. At the conclusion of this course students will have a sound knowledge of the legal principles and rules applicable in this field and will have a better understanding of how international lawyers and other actors ought to approach an impending or ongoing ethnic conflict from a legal point of view.",

Students completing this course will have acquired sufficient knowledge and skills to enable them to enrol in the other more specialist courses in government and regulation.\n\nThe course will include:\nAn introduction to the concept of regulation and mechanisms used to achieve regulatory outcomes.The ability to find and interpret various regulatory sources, including legislation, industry codes, and court judgements, and anticipate or recognise their regulatory intent;An understanding of the influence of underlying constitutional and institutional frameworks in which those regulatory sources operate, including the role of private law.\n\nThis course is a prerequisite for students without a law degree who wish to study further courses in the government and regulation stream. It is an introductory course. Students with a law degree, particularly international students, who want to revisit some of the foundational elements of the Australian legal framework, and particularly public law, are encouraged to discuss the course with the convenor prior to enrolment.\n\u00a0",

Both traditional and innovative theories and methodologies are shaped by the study of two large language families: Indo-European, encompassing languages from Ireland in western Europe to India and Bangladesh in South Asia; and Austronesian, which spans Asia and the Pacific, from Taiwan to Easter Island.

You will receive comprehensive practical training in how to articulate and perceive different speech sounds and transcribe them using the International Phonetic alphabet, and learn about relevant aspects of anatomy, physics and cognition. You will also develop skills in computer aided phonetic analysis using open source software, and methods of data collection for phonetic and phonological research. You will gain extensive experience in applying principles of phonological analysis to describe and represent distinctions and distributional patterns in the sound systems of different languages, and undertake in-depth research on a specific language.

We investigate the elements of grammar (syntax and morphology), as well as exploring connections between grammar and meaning (semantics). We begin with the grammar of Standard Modern English, learning terms and analytical techniques which linguists use to study and describe grammar. The structural characteristics of English are compared with those of other languages. We then examine variation in English, including regional dialects, social and stylistic variation.\u00a0 Special attention is paid to 'new Englishes'\u00a0 which are varieties of English that exist alongside other languages in bi- or multilingual contexts such as in Singapore or India.Note: While the course is not aimed at improving the English of non-native speakers, students with English as a second language should find that this course will improve their understanding of the workings of the language at a deep level and have practical effects in helping them to eliminate systematic errors in their English.\u00a0 These students as well as native speakers of English will learn metalanguage which will be of assistance to them in understanding and acting on constructive criticisms made by teachers on the language of their essays and other writing.",

These differences can be profound and systematic. Today\u2019s transnational flows of people, ideas, languages, and practices mean that we encounter these differences in contexts ranging from home, school, hospital, workplaces, to international business, tourism, diplomacy and humanitarian work. This drives the need to understand both \u2018cross-cultural communication\u2019 (communication across different groups and societies) and \u2018intercultural communication\u2019 (communication within groups and societies). \u00a0How people choose to interact with others stems from the languages they speak, and also from their histories, the values of the groups they identify with, their relations with their interactants, the goals of the interaction, the setting in which it takes place and the medium (digital, face-to-face, written). \u00a0We explore these from a linguistic perspective, critically examining the empirical basis for claims made about communication in a range of societies including, for example, Australia, the US, Indigenous Australia, China, France, Germany, Japan, Israel, Korea, and Hispanic speech communities. A general framework for understanding verbal as well as non-verbal communication across and between groups is outlined, drawing on insights from linguistics, psychology, anthropology, tourism, media and communication studies.\n\t\u00a0",

In the modern state, language tests are powerful tools of policy. They can be used to reduce the risk of miscommunication in the workplace, or to measure educational achievement, but they can also be used to filter linguistic diversity or to exclude certain groups. Starting from the concept of \u2018a language\u2019, this course explores the complex relationships between language use, language acquisition, and mechanisms, such as policies, standardized tests and assessment processes. Throughout the course, there is an emphasis on both theory and practice. Students will examine a range of policy contexts and learn about the principles of language test design and validation, enabling them to make critical and informed connections between government or institutional policies, their instruments and the sociopolitical priorities that drive them. They will have the opportunity to explore a particular assessment or policy context in detail. The course is co-constructed: students will contribute to the course content by selecting and reporting on case studies of interest to them. They will gain exposure to a range of relevant genres, including assessment instruments, policy documents, public information, popular media and academic studies.",

Austronesian is the world's largest language family in terms of geographical spread, spanning more than half the globe: from Madagascar to Easter Island, and from Taiwan to New Zealand. This vast and diverse language family is also one of the best documented. It includes both major world languages with millions of speakers, like Indonesian and Tagalog, and tiny Oceanic languages spoken on remote islands with only a couple of hundred speakers. During the course, students will learn about the migration and dispersion of the Austronesian people and salient features characterising their languages, social organisations and cultures. Case studies are used to represent certain salient Austronesian features in relation to particular (sub)regions and societies to cover topics in Austronesian sound systems and grammars, writing systems, ritual language and religions, language contact and change, language ecology, the politics of language, language landscape and verbal arts.\u00a0",

Whether we are required to learn a language at school, or whether the need is driven by economic opportunity, survival, ancestral connection or even love, the human capacity to learn new languages raises many questions. How do humans manage the complex task of learning new linguistic structures? Why are some people better at language learning than others? What is the relationship in the mind between established and new language patterns? How can we learn languages more effectively? This course offers insight into these and other questions through critically examining theoretical approaches, empirical methods and findings in second language acquisition research. Topics include features of language learners and their learning processes (e.g., age, crosslinguistic influences), individual influences on language development (e.g., motivation, aptitude) and social dimensions (e.g., identity, community). Students will be encouraged to reflect critically on their own experiences as language learners and/or their experiences in relevant professional capacities. Students will have an opportunity to develop independence as an emerging researcher through carrying out their own study on an aspect of language learning that interests them.",

Forensic linguistics is a diverse field that not only has applications in legal and criminal investigations, but also makes important contributions to the military, government and business, and can contribute to literary, historical and cultural studies.\nIn this course we go through the various sub-fields and issues of forensic linguistics; for example, voice comparison, speaker profiling, authorship analysis, disputed utterance, plagiarism, transcription, translation-interpreting, interrogation and verballing, while explaining the nature of linguistic evidence and the role that linguistics and languages play in the legal proceedings. We also learn about the use of computational and statistical tools in linguistic analyses. The course has no prerequisites; the necessary basic linguistic and statistical ideas and tools will be introduced and explained.\nStudents are expected to demonstrate that they can appropriately apply their acquired skills and knowledge to actual linguistic data, and then that they can provide an in-depth analysis of the data. They are also expected to critically discuss the results of the analysis by referring to the issues of \u201cLanguage and the Law\u201d and the nature of linguistic evidence.",

Along the way, children make adjustments to how they produce utterances and interpret what they hear. Understanding out how we do this takes us on a fascinating journey, visiting research highlights that speak to the core of human cognition and social interaction. What psycholinguistic processes explain an utterance such as \"Nail polish me!\" or \"We holded the baby\u00a0 rabbits\"? What conclusions can we draw about what is universal in language development versus what is language or culture specific? Do children always imitate their care-givers or do they bring innovations into a language? We will explore the development of language abilities from several perspectives, including unilingual and multilingual contexts, and across languages of different types, drawing on differing theoretical approaches.",

How is language structured to enable it to do the social work that is necessary for interaction? We survey key concepts and methods that have been used in sociolinguistic research to answer these questions, examining language across different social contexts, and as used by different social groups.

This course is aimed at a better understanding of Islam, Islamic movements, Islamic revivalism or Islamism in a variety of settings.\u00a0 Specifically, it is a course about how to think about Islamic radicalism as a conglomeration of context-specific policies, projects, ideals, institutions, and movements that have their origin in Muslim societies\u2019 response to \u201cmodernity\u201d.\u00a0 It is designed to introduce students to major theoretical perspectives on Islamism, and its practical manifestations in individual countries (not confined to the Arab World), as well as in the regional and global arena.",

In discussing what constitutes \u2018development\u2019 and how it can be measured, various currents in contemporary discourse about development (or in reaction against development) will be examined, using Western and indigenous perceptions.

The opening up of the region\u2019s hydrocarbon reserves represents one of the most significant consequences of the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse in 1991. Potential benefits from energy development to national and commercial entities are enormous, but so are the challenges stemming from the expansion of global economy, international and intra-regional competition, and the internal political dynamics of the Caspian states. The region is at the crossroads: from its current volatile situation, it could evolve either as an area of crisis, or as a zone of stability. The dynamics of energy development will be crucial for determining the actual outcome.\nThe course will address the politics of hydrocarbons in the Caucasus and Central Asia as a security problem. While substantial attention will be paid to the traditional balance-of-power contest involving external states, such as Russia, the USA, China, Turkey, and Iran, it will attempt to go beyond pure geopolitics and address broader questions: Is energy development making conflict more or less likely in the region? What will be the domestic impact of the expected hydrocarbon boom? What are the implications for the human and natural environment?",

The course is aimed at significantly improving the ability of practicing managers to be effective global managers. The course is concerned with considering the issues and problems of managing in cross-cultural situations, in particular at the people problems that invariably arise in international business relationships. Failure on the part of managers to understand and deal with the difference in attitudes, values and behaviour of those with whom they interact in business transactions consistently has been shown to be a major source of difficulties. The course will involve marrying theories and concepts from the broad fields of culture and international business and applying them to problems typically confronted by managers involved in international business. The course will draw on the existing knowledge and expertise of the class participants to solve problems relevant to them and their organisations. Students will be required to apply relevant research discussed in the course to realistic business cases.",

The emphasis is less about being entitled to be a leader and more about how participants can become leaders that they themselves would like to be. This is a challenging question and gets to the heart of one's major life decisions.

This course helps to further develop and strengthen all functional skills and core evidence-informed decision-making capabilities (in particular the Assess & Apply skills), and also how to translate knowledge into an organisational setting.\n\nIn this course after two weeks of classes on evidence-based decision-making and practice tools and frameworks, MBA candidates will work individually on a 10-week self-directed applied project to develop, design, and implement (if warranted and feasible), an evidence-based innovative management decision to address a complex real world problem, opportunity, or innovation challenge (preferably within their organisation). In the evidence-based practice in Management course at the start of the program, MBA candidates are tasked with a CAT (Critically Appraised Topic) where they examine the science behind a complex problem in their organisations. In this course, MBA candidates may choose to develop a solution to the problem that they carefully identified and analysed using an evidence-based approach, of which they may have an evolved understanding and appreciation of, in the evidence-based practice in Management course at the start of the MBA program.\u00a0\n\nThere are several different options for the applied project:\nA piloting and implementation proposal that relies on designing an evidence-based intervention or innovation in collaboration with their own organisation or an organisation of their choice. The outcome of this option is the proposal of methodological instruments and a well-laid out plan for implementation of the project.\u00a0A consultancy report that requires the MBA candidate to act as a consultant to work on a real-life management or business problem of an organisation, a business, or a department that requires their evidence-based decision-making and practice skills and knowledge to propose solutions through a properly structured and presented consultancy project (practicum).\u00a0A thesis related to an empirical problem within the candidate\u2019s organisation or a department, business of their choice using an evidence-based management framework displaying all the related capabilities to ultimately propose appropriate evidence-based decision-making and practice solutions and show academic contributions to the field of evidence-based decision-making and practice.\u00a0An Evidence-Based Intervention or Innovation Proposal - For this option, MBA candidates have to write a report which will be presented to their organisation. In the report they are required to design and plan an evidence-based intervention or innovation, in collaboration with their organisation, with the purpose of piloting and implementation, to address a complex problem, opportunity, or innovation challenge.",

Issues examined during the course include the history of collecting and exhibitions, community representation, ownership and intellectual property, repatriation, negotiation, preservation, and modes of display.",

We investigate the idea of the museum as contested ground and examine the complex and shifting relationships between museums and the diverse communities they serve. We explore how objects and collections acquire meaning and how those meanings are conveyed to museum visitors, ask why some cultural forms and objects become iconic, debate the elements of a successful exhibition and consider the range of skills and practices applied in contemporary museum and collecting practices. In investigating various approaches to these questions, the course links key concepts in museum studies to specific case studies.",

It aims to inform and critically reflect on Indigenous peoples' efforts to secure the return of ancestral remains and on the development of repatriation policies.\u00a0The course considers repatriation both in the domestic and international context. The course will:\n\n\u2022 Conceptualise the main issues pertaining to the repatriation of Indigenous ancestral remains, including its historical, ethical and cultural context.\n\u2022 Explore deeper understandings of repatriation and its inter-connectedness with Indigenous law, culture, ethics, country and community development.\n\u2022 Consider key aspects of the reburial debate and its influence on museum practice.\n\u2022 Interpret relevant institutional, agency and government policy regimes, including professional codes of practice and ethics.\n\u2022 Explore repatriation in its international context.\n\nThis course allows students to develop a holistic understanding of repatriation, its history and significance. It provides practical skills to assist in the development of repatriation processes and\u00a0features a range of guest lectures and workshops led by Indigenous and non-Indigenous repatriation practitioners from communities, museums, universities and government.\n\nThe course may be delivered in different locations depending on community availability, current debates, and policy developments. To provide students with the opportunity to learn about repatriation issues from Traditional Owners on country,\u00a0the intention is that the course is delivered on Ngarrindjeri country in South Australia, or on Yawuru and Bunuba country in the Kimberley. Applicants are advised that due to circumstances beyond the University's control (for example, internal border restrictions or areas of high risk) it may not be possible for students to commence or complete this course on location as advertised, in which case an alternative online lesson plan will be arranged to fulfil the course requirements.\n\nStudents are required to pay their own fieldwork costs.\n\nStudents will only be permitted to travel upon completion of ANU required documentation and the approval of all documentation by the relevant delegate.",

There is currently a global industry arising from the conversion of former sites of imprisonment to tourist attractions. Parliament houses and law courts, as either decommissioned or as functional sites of law-making and keeping, manage and display collections, conduct public tours and implement conservation heritage plans. In addition, there is an international push for museums to actively support social justice by ensuring that the whole of the public can benefit from museum resources. This course will focus on these intersections between museums and heritage sites with social justice, criminal justice, law making, and associated mechanisms of democracy.\nUsing theories and methods of sociology, human rights, cultural studies and the politics of representation, this course analyses the role of museums and heritage management in the history and practice of notions of justice, including in those countries where democracy has been threatened. In addition to lectures and multi-media recordings of international approaches to the depiction of human rights and social justice programmes in museums, students will also engage in direct learning experiences through field trips in Canberra and regional NSW.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Students will be required to participate in excursions within Canberra and in regional New South Wales, which may include an overnight stay in regional NSW. Students will need to cover the cost of their accommodation. Transport will be provided.

Cultural-theoretical backdrops include a consideration of sound recording technology, ethnomusicology, feminism and 'queer theory'.

The subject matter includes: the challenge of translating national security concepts into addressing practical policy problems; the nature, purpose and limitations of national security policymaking; actors, interests and structures in national security; practical aspects of national security policymaking including strategy, risk management and the impact of technology; the role of the private sector, interest groups, the media and academia/think tanks; national security policymaking in comparative perspective; and prospects for reform.\nIn line with the NSC\u2019s signature pedagogy, this course is delivered as a collaboration between an academic convener and a policy practitioner. Guest presentations are included, both from other national security academics and from current and former senior policymakers, with the course convener and practitioner acting as discussants to sustain engagement with the content combining concepts and practice. Several of the seminars in the course provide a preview of other national security (elective) courses, improving students\u2019 ability to structure their study experience. A highlight of the course is a fully-fledged exercise simulating whole-of-government national security policymaking in a crisis scenario.",

How does it relate to international and domestic security? How does national security relate to interests, values and identity? Beyond the headlines and the politics, how can we distinguish what really constitutes a national security threat? How can we critically assess the security policy responses that governments make? This course equips students with conceptual and analytical skills and frameworks to address these core questions. \n\u00a0\nHaving established the complexities of 21st century national security and assessed different definitions of national security in terms of interests, values and identity, we will look at threats and risks emanating from the international, domestic and individual realms. The course enables student to assess the causal role of these variables, looking at the comparative method and more complex causal dynamics including path dependence and feedback, as well as how to use (and not to use) history to support policy prescriptions. Students will apply these tools to texts ranging from Australian government policy statements to canonical scholarly works to illuminate their strengths and weaknesses. Students will interact with policy practitioners to understand how conceptual frameworks help explain the ways in which contemporary security challenges are understood by government. The course concludes by setting the scene for a subsequent course on translating conceptual analysis into making policy. Learning activities will include lectures, tutorials, analytical exercises and interactive discussions with a team combining academic experts and senior policy practitioners, in line with the National Security College\u2019s signature pedagogy.",

            "description": "National security and economics are often treated as separate realms, both in policymaking and scholarship. But the early 21st century is marked by a convergence of security and economic factors in the national security challenges facing governments. This course introduces students to the intersection of security and economics, captured in the concept of \u2018geoeconomics\u2019. It focuses on the uses \u2013 and limitations \u2013 of economic relations as an instrument of state power. Students are introduced to the longstanding connection between economics and national security; basic principles of economic theory; the mechanisms/instruments of geoeconomic statecraft (such as trade, finance and institutions); contemporary geoeconomic challenges, such as economic coercion, critical infrastructure and critical technologies; and the policy challenges involved in developing national responses that integrate security and economic considerations. The course will take a global perspective, but with case studies focused on China, the Indo-Pacific and Australia.\n\u00a0\nThis course combines academic expertise with insights from policy practitioners. The course convener will draw upon a research background in relevant non-security disciplines (such as economics or law) to guide students towards a more integrated understanding of security and economic issues. The course will be practically focused, integrating perspectives from the national security and economic policy domains, including input from a practitioner with recent experience in developing geoeconomic policy. In line with the National Security College's signature pedagogy, the policy practitioner will serve as a discussant to contextualise academic analysis within policy experience and advise on an in-class policy exercise and a policy-oriented assessment item.",

It is organised around three core questions: (i) how do the United States and China respectively understand national security?; (ii) how have changing power dynamics between the two affected their geopolitical, geoecominc and institutional preferences?; (iii) how might this impact their handling of potential flashpoints in their relationship?; and iv) what are the implications for the security interests of third countries, notably Australia?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPart 1, drawing on international relations, foreign policy and security analysis, examines the sources of national security policy and interests in both states, incorporating individual policy makers, characteristics of domestic institutions and political environment, and international systemic factors. Part 2 then considers the evolution of Chinese and American geopolitical, geoeconomic and institutional preferences. It does so by interrogating the US role in the construction of the \u201cliberal international order\u201d, China\u2019s alternative model based on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and possible future \u2018ordering\u2019 scenarios. Part 3 concludes the course by exploring how Chinese and American approaches to national security strategy might affect their responses to future tensions, including over North Korea and the South China Sea. Part 4 considers implications for third countries and Australia in particular.\n\nStudents taking this course will gain an understanding of both conceptual and applied knowledge, as well as awareness of key contemporary controversies in Sino-American relations and their effects on Australia\u2019s national security environment. This will enable them to make informed policy-focused evaluations of the subject matter. Policy practitioner perspectives will be integrated into the course to assist in this regard. ",

The enactment of multiple laws granting new powers to police and national security agencies to deal with specific national security threats is a visible way law is used as a national security tool.\u00a0On the other hand, Australia\u2019s legal institutions and systems play an important role in ensuring that the State\u2019s powers over citizens in the name of national security are exercised consistently with Australia\u2019s character as a liberal democratic society.\n\u00a0\nThis course is designed specifically for students of national security policy \u2013 including serving and prospective policymakers. It will examine the intersections between Australian laws and legal systems and national security issues. After setting out the foundations and basic legal architecture of Australia\u2019s national security institutions and agencies, this course will focus on specific areas where the law has been used as a key mechanism for implementing national security policy.\u00a0These include in-depth examination of the laws designed to manage national security risks from foreign influence to pandemics, and which empower agencies to gather intelligence. These sessions aim to integrate perspectives from academics with those of national security practitioners.\u00a0The seminar/tutorial activities will enable students to translate these insights into the skills of security policy makers, for example identifying when specialist legal advice is required, or how to develop,\u00a0and publicly justify, a proposal for legislative reform. A final key theme running through this course is to question when the law can (or should) be used as a national security tool.\u00a0Students will thus gain in-depth understanding of the process by which Australian national security law is made, and how (and why) the use of this body of law is oversighted.

It does so through an explicitly multi-disciplinary approach that incorporates historical (\"new\" and \"old\" terrorism); conceptual (state-sponsored vs. non-state; global vs. regional; biological, environmental, cultural, political); and geographical (Middle East and Africa, Eurasia, South America) frameworks. \n\u00a0\nWe begin by examining the historical evolution of terrorism, its causes/rationales, and the major theoretical and conceptual approaches to help understand it. We then explore the development of historical and contemporary terrorist groups, including the recent 'fourth wave' of terrorism (e.g. al-Qaeda and ISIS) as well as the rise to prominence of far-right wing terrorism. The final part of the course focuses explicitly on counter-terrorism responses and counter-terrorism policies in the context of national security policy formulation. In particular we will examine the implications of terrorism for the national security postures of Australia, of key states in Australia's neighborhood, and of the United States as Australia\u2019s ally. Counter-terrorism practitioners will support this course with insights from the practical challenges of sustaining effective security policy against this evolving risk.",

Paradoxically the region still has some of the poorest health outcomes in all other areas and health in the Pacific, and health of Pacific peoples, has long been a  critical development concern for Pacific island governments, communities, and aid agencies, including Australia and the World Health Organization. This course examines the region's health status and policy responses at the local, national, regional and global level. Drawing on DPA\u2019s expertise in Pacific societies and systems, and our training in political science, development studies, anthropology, population health, and indigenous health, this course is able to provide in-depth investigation of critical health issues in Pacific Island Countries. We begin by examining the health status of the region followed by analysing the health responses and health service delivery across the region with a focus on case studies at the regional, national and local level. Examples of case studies will include comparing the impacts of Covid-19 across the region, population politics, gender dimensions of health, HIV/AIDS, communicable and non-communicable diseases, mental health and addictions, climate change and food security. In each case we ask what are the key contributors, what policies are trying to address these challenges, and how do culture, development and politics shape health challenges and responses. This course is ideal for students and/or practitioners who wish to better understand the critical health challenges in the Pacific including from policy, development, cultural, and governance perspectives. Those who currently work in the Pacific or wish to do so will benefit from detailed examination and understanding of major health issues and responses, while those students who are studying health will access unique Pacific content and case studies.\u00a0",

The course examines the debates about universalism and relativism, nature and culture, and personhood and identity, in understanding the differences between women, men, and transgendered persons. The course takes a historical and contextual approach to examine the transformations of patterns of gender and sexuality in the Pacific through the successive encounters of exploratory voyages, Christian missions, labour trade and plantation development, World War II and militarism, and mobility and the diaspora. Key thematic areas will include contemporary debates about women\u2019s influence and participation in church and state; gendered economies, kinship and land; transnational and regional feminisms and human rights; gender violence; gender, sexuality, health and HIV; and gender and sexual identities. The course will integrate readings and performances of literature, drama, and visual media by both Oceanic and foreign authors and artists. Indigenous Pacific Islander approaches to engaging and learning about Oceania are highlighted. The course draws upon the extensive academic expertise at ANU in gender and Pacific studies and is especially suitable for students of anthropology, history, politics, gender, sexuality and culture, Pacific studies, and development studies in both CAP and CASS. It will focus on Fiji, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu but bring in comparisons across Oceania.",

It considers the factors shaping the conduct of elections across the region, and implications of elections for democracy, governance, development and security. Incorporating insights from comparative politics, anthropology and development studies, the course explores how elections in the region differ from developed country electoral experiences and what this means for efforts to support electoral processes. Implications for the development of electoral support programs that respond to the specific Melanesian context are also considered.\nThe focus of the readings is to provide a deeper grounded and contextual understanding of elections, drawing heavily on applied research conducted in Melanesian countries. Regional case studies are used to elucidate key aspects of elections.\n\nTopics of study include:\nThe political economy of elections in MelanesiaElections and (in)securityElections, governance and developmentMoney politics and electoral competition in MelanesiaPolitical parties and campaigningElections, ICTs and social mediaWomen and electionsElectoral administration and electoral integrity in MelanesiaElections in PNGElections in Solomon IslandsElections and external actorsSupporting elections in Melanesia",

With this, Papua New Guinea and Bougainville enter an unprecedented phase in their history. How did this happen? Where does it lead? How does what has happened in Bougainville relate to the broader context of Papua New Guinea, Melanesia and the region? These are challenging and as yet not fully answered questions now faced by Bougainvilleans, Papua New Guineans, and also their neighbours, including Australia. This course aims to provide its participants with a strong knowledge base from which to understand and participate in the conversations now taking place regarding the future of Bougainville.\nIn this course we will examine the origins of Bougainville nationalism and situate it within the context in which it emerged: colonial and post-colonial Papua New Guinea. We will follow the history of the Bougainville conflict, or kraisis, and the decade-long search for peace, and compare the development of these political movements and those elsewhere in PNG. Careful attention will be paid to the political dynamics in the period after the establishment of the Autonomous Bougainville Government, to seek to understand how a once radical position became de facto government policy. Finally, we will examine the referendum vote itself and its implications.\n\nTopics covered under the course:\nDriman (dream): the significance of the Bougainvillean referendumGavman blo mipela (our government): the context and origins of Bougainvillean nationalism.Kraisis na bel isi (crisis and peace): the Bougainville Conflict and peace processOtonamas i stap pinis (autonomy is here): Autonomous Bougainville GovernmentVot blo yumi (our vote): the referendum, its administration and politicsBruklus?

A recent trend in development research has been to work with local researchers in equitable partnerships to design and implement research projects that meaningfully resonate with them and their communities. This trend responds to a growing evidence base that research in the Pacific has mirrored colonialist frames of inquiry, without nuanced understanding of local context, and without privileging the voices of the most marginalised in those societies. The course will present strategies to strengthen inclusivity in both the methods and content of Pacific research, to ensure the voices of women, people with disability, the politically marginalised and those living in remote communities are heard. The course will draw upon the expertise of DPA's Pacific Islands Research Fellows.",

Many properties of these collections are independent of atomic details: examples are the direction of heat flow, that liquids more readily boil at lower pressure, and that the maximum efficiency of an engine depends upon temperature range and not the working fluid and the set of principles that govern these generic properties is referred to as classical thermodynamics. Other properties do depend upon atomic details - the framework by which we relate the quantum behaviour of one individual particle and to properties of a collection of large number of these particles is referred to as statistical mechanics. From understanding the greenhouse effect to the blackbody radiation left over from the Big Bang, no other physical theory is used more widely through out science than thermal physics.\nThis course provides an introduction to classical thermodynamics, with applications in materials science & engineering and earth science, as well as statistical thermodynamics, with applications in solid state physics and astrophysics.\nNote: Graduate students attend joint classes with undergraduates but are assessed separately.",

Objects can be imaged in 2D or 3D with various probes including electromagnetic radiation, particles, and acoustic waves. Advanced imaging is becoming increasingly important, producing imaging systems with significantly enhanced capabilities such as in ground-penetrating radar, magnetic resonance imaging, synthetic aperture radar, hyperspectral imaging, and computed tomography.While this unique course will cover conventional imaging techniques, the focus will be more on advanced imaging for specific applications. It will include case-studies of some of the state-of-the-art instruments and techniques used by world-class scientists in Astronomy, Geophysics, and Physics researchers here at ANU.

Emphasis is on a comparative approach.Questions to be addressed include:\n  How expensive is the Welfare State?  \t\t\t\tIssues to be dealt with include the growth in welfare spending in Australia and internationally and the causal factors associated with these trends; issues of definition of the welfare state, including the relationship between public and private welfare, and occupational welfare, and the role of the tax system and its interactions with public spending.    How effective is the Welfare State?  \t\t\t\tWhat are the impacts of social spending and taxation on income inequality and poverty, moving from cash benefits and personal taxes to government provided services and indirect taxes; does the welfare state have unintended consequences that undermine redistribution through impacts on incentives to work and save and form families; does the welfare state have indirect positive effects on social performance, boosting social solidarity and other wellbeing outcomes. \t\t\t\tWhat are the social policy challenges facing developing Asian and Pacific countries in coming decades, including trends in inequality and the consequences of population ageing and demographic change? Is there an Asian social policy model or models that can deal effectively with these challenges?\u00a0 Are the policy approaches developed and used in OECD countries relevant to Asia and the Pacific. What are appropriate the analytical frameworks and tools to assess these questions?  \n  Is the Welfare State sustainable?\nThe financial crisis in North Atlantic economies has resulted in significant growth in public spending in many countries and falling tax revenues, leading to higher public debt.\u00a0 Some countries have embarked on austerity packages.\u00a0 These trends coincide with the first cohort of the baby boom population reaching age 65, and projected further substantial increases in welfare state spending on pensions, health care and services for the frail aged.

It is also vital for us to think deeply and systematically about where the region is headed tomorrow - whether the question is economic growth, environmental quality, or military conflict - even as we recognize that our ability to predict the future is limited.This course will equip students to grapple with the challenge of making policy in a rapidly changing region by introducing them to a few key tools. It will introduce students to the study of international relations, focusing on a select number of trends that are recognized as particularly important drivers of international change. In addition, it will introduce students to the concept and practice of scenario development, a technique used widely in both the private and the public sector as a means of thinking about and preparing for the future. Students will draw on both of these tools to develop scenarios that depict key aspects of the future in the Asia-Pacific region, building on course material and on their own expertise and research.

This subject will combine examination of the theoretical underpinnings of leadership with practical personal development tools, in the context of the social context of government and the key drivers of public sector change.

What theories, ideas and assumptions underpin the SDGs?\u00a0Are they a departure from international efforts that came before? Do the 17 SDGs represent a genuine consensus on development, or do they mask ongoing deep divides?\nThe SDGs represent agreement on a global agenda to \u2018promote prosperity while protecting the planet.\u2019 Yet as poverty and inequality continue to plague the lives of much of the world's population, development often seems elusive. Despite the representation of the SDGs as a global consensus, the very concept of development remains contested.\nThis course critically examines some of the major themes that have shaped \u2013 and continue to shape \u2013 global development efforts. It places several of the themes represented in the SDGs under the spotlight, exploring their origins, the often contested ideas and theories that underpin them, and the ongoing debates. The course does not assume there is a single or a correct approach towards development. Rather, using the SDGs as a prism, it aims to explore and critically assess the ideas, values and assumptions that have shaped international development agendas.",

The course will identify the economy and how we measure it. It will frame public budgeting for the financing of government through taxation, borrowing and other means and will introduce concepts of deficit and government debt, fiscal austerity, economic stimulus and other fiscal policy approaches.The course will provide a framework for understanding the strengths and limits of markets as a form of social organization and for identifying the precise nature of market failure, the objectives of public policy and forms of government intervention, for example by regulation, expenditures, service provision, redistribution and taxation. Participants will examine the efficiency of resource allocation in the economy as a whole and at the micro level in decision making by individuals, firms and government actors. The idea of the efficiency of resource allocation will be emphasised and developed by providing concrete examples and applications.\n\u00a0",

The course examines strategies and tactics used by policy advocates inside and outside government when marshalling argument and evidence to promote their preferred outcomes. The course is designed to strengthen students' understanding of the nature of advocacy and of place of policy advocacy in the policy process. The course materials draw on many disciplines: rhetoric, philosophy, policy analysis and public administration. Examples include many Australian, as well as international and transnational cases, but the aim is more general: to stimulate learning about the many ways that policy advocacy is pursued and seeks to shape policy choice, especially in political systems with open forms of deliberative democracy.\nInnovations include the regular use of video material illustrating classic advocacy practices used by policy makers, prominent public leaders and interest groups. You will also be taught how to conduct your own analysis of advocacy strategies through examining and comparing policy documents. The Brick of required readings draws from the classics such as Aristotle\u2019s rhetoric but also more recent applications and developments in examining and understanding the significance of the art of persuasion, such as through discourse analysis but also experimentalist governance.",

            "description": "This course aims to provide an introduction to the main principles of social policy in a comparative context as a foundation for further studies in the social policy area. It discusses the parameters of social policy and how social policy intersects with other aspects of government policy, such as labour policy, taxation policy and health policy. It analyses varying models of social welfare provision and social protection as well as fundamental policy issues, such as the merits of targeting versus universality, horizontal versus vertical equity, and rights-based versus discretionary entitlements. The course then considers social protection in the context of key groups of potential beneficiaries, including the unemployed, children and families, retirees, and the indigenous. Emphasis is on a comparative approach, comparing Australian social policy with that of other OECD countries and of other countries in the Asia and Pacific region.Topics to be covered include:\n\u00a0the boundaries of social policycontrasting models of welfare and the welfare statethe intersections between economic and social policy international comparisonssocial policy priorities in developed and developing countriesdemographics of ageing and fertilitypoverty, inequality and adequacywelfare reformlabour market assistance and the unemployedchildren and family policywork and familysole parents and child supportage pension and retirement supportindigenous social policyhealth and health insurancethe future of social policy",

            "description": "Most of the world's population live in cities, where many of the world's big challenges combine, from climate change to inequality.\u00a0To meet contemporary challenges, it is imperative that policy makers can measure the demographic and economic drivers behind urbanisation patterns as well as understand their social and environmental outcomes. It is equally imperative that policy makers have the skills to work collectively with communities, political leaders as well as for-profit and non-profit organisations to guide decision-making on complex urban problems in a way that builds resilient cities. This involves an integrated approach to examining urban problems and designing solutions that can weigh up economic development considerations with social policy priorities as well as environmental management needs.\n\nThis course is designed for those interested in complex urban problems and integrating policy making to build more resilient cities. It provides an overview of common problems faced in cities over time as part of urbanisation processes and utilises urban and governance theory to consider different interpretations of these problems. Students will also utilise different analytical techniques to study these multifaceted problems. Then, some contemporary solutions designed to resolve complex urban problems are examined, with a particular focus on governance approaches that integrate policy areas in cities, for example in programs relating to urban renewal and informal settlement upgrading to large-scale infrastructure planning and urban river basin management. In this regard, attention is given to the important collaborative, boundary spanning and inter-jurisdictional work required of public policy practitioners in working to address complex urban problems. \n\nStudents will be invited to imagine themselves in the situation of other actors in the urban policy making and governance process so as to understand and empathise with different perspectives in a way that seeks agreement without avoiding conflict nor striving for consensus.",

How do citizens themselves seek to voice their concerns and exert influence on the policy process? What happens when their interests are mis-represented, misunderstood or ignored? What does meaningful citizen participation look like in an era of 24/7 news cycles and social media? In focusing on 'public' aspects of public policy, this course engages students in various democratic issues that surface in the public policy process. Through applied examples and case studies, students reflect on how democratic ideals, such as inclusion, participation, representation and legitimacy may be realised in contemporary governance. Practical attempts at participatory policy making will be examined and critiqued, including deliberative forums, community meetings, petitions, online engagement and social media.\u00a0",

Australia is no less in need of understanding the interactions of science and technology with policy. This understanding includes the evidence S&T can provide to underpin policy, and the areas where science and technology could influence the directions of Australia in the absence of effective policy.\n\nThis course provides a comprehensive approach to exploring the interactions between science, technology and public policy across a suite of policy areas. It is built on a teaching collaboration between two ANU Colleges (Asia and the Pacific; and Science), bringing together expertise from the Crawford School of Public Policy and the Australian National Centre for Public Awareness of Science (CPAS).\n\nIt will be interactive, and every session will use policy experts along with academic staff to ensure relevance and depth in the analyses. The course will be flexible, and arranged to maximise access by students who may be either full or part-time. It will consist of two 6-unit components; the first will be a prerequisite for the second. The first 6 units will be split between sessions exploring theoretical and practical underpinnings of how science, technology and public policy are undertaken and case studies exploring how these underpinnings play out, and might need to be revised, in real-world public policy situations. The second 6 units will consist entirely of case studies of increasing complexity as students hone their skills in extracting lessons and developing deeper understanding from examples presented by experienced academics and practitioners of public policy.\n\nStudents will be allowed to take its first 6 units or the full 12 units as contributions towards a postgraduate qualification, the 12 unit option contributing to a Science, Technology and Public Policy specialization.",

We will examine policy instruments such as exchange rates, interest rates, international debt, budget deficit, and trade deficit, to understand their composition and effects on domestic economy, employment, investment, development, and international trade, the promises they provide, the problems they pose, and what needs to be considered in conjunction with these instruments.

At the same time, governments face crucial public policy problems in responding to climate change. Governments are also increasingly supporting the energy transition through the tools of green industry policy, seeking to promote job creation, economic growth, and competitiveness in key industries such as wind power, solar photovoltaics, transport, and hydrogen.\n\nIn this course we consider the role of public policy in supporting the low carbon energy transition. We examine historical development patterns of low carbon energy technologies, how national innovation systems work, what policy instruments can be used in supporting innovation and industry formation, and how these issues shape international competitiveness of domestic industries for low carbon energy technologies. We look at the challenges facing energy transitions in Australia, but also across the world, particularly China, India, and other countries. We will consider how political factors shape energy transitions. Finally, we will look ahead and discuss how the dynamics of energy transitions worldwide, and global competition in innovation and industrial performance, are changing. Students will engage with scholars and practitioners working on energy issues in an interactive and group-based learning environment.",

It is also safe, has a peace clause in its constitution and has played an important role in economic development in Asia. But Japan faces major challenges with an ageing and shrinking population, two decades of slow growth, rising inequality, a democracy dominated by one party, rapid and major change in its immediate regional neighbourhood and unresolved history and uneasy relations with its neighbours upon which it relies for economic prosperity. Japan is a unique country in a unique situation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis course tackles the big policy questions facing Japan - many of which can be applied to thinking about other countries. The course exposes students to the key policy debates in Japan and draws upon not only the strong academic expertise at ANU but also the expertise and experience of a range of top scholars and thinkers on Japan who will guest lecture and join the student debates and presentations. The course includes participation at the annual Japan Update conference and connects policy relevant research to teaching in an innovative way.",

Students will consider a variety of policy actors, power relations, and inequalities in the policy process, and reflect on how competing values and interests influence what issues get policy attention, how they shape decisions, outcomes and evaluation procedures.\u00a0",

Particular emphasis in the course is given to how various political, regulatory, administrative and communicative institutions shape the process and outcomes of public policy. Throughout the course students will engage critically in ideas on the structures of policy making, including the role of constitutions, the executive, the bureaucracy, the judiciary and other regulators, political parties, elections and the media. The public policy consequences of different jurisdictional arrangements is also examined looking at the benefits and challenges of centralisation and decentralization. Students will also consider how globalization and the proliferation of transnational policy issues are challenging national systems of government.",

Environmental controversies, inequality within and between nations, and changing population dynamics typify these challenges. Students explore how policy processes in such contexts are far from regularized or systematic. When familiar economic, political, administrative and communicative processes are under extreme pressure or break down entirely, policy-makers are often dealing with what are referred to as \u2018wicked problems\u2019, for which there are no clear policy solutions, and few examples of successful policy on which to draw. In this course, students consider what happens under such dynamic circumstances, and explore the responses of governments, policy actors, and policy systems. The course employs the case method of teaching, and students consider different approaches for planning and steering public policy under conditions of extreme complexity, uncertainty and risk.\nThis course gives students a unique and exciting experience where the various perspectives that derive from professional experience, cultural and national diversity and disciplinary backgrounds are brought to bear on critical challenges confronting policy-makers. Crawford students either already do, or soon will, play an important part in informing, crafting, influencing, and implementing policy. In this course we provide an opportunity for students to develop and enhance the skills required to fulfil these roles.",

Most theories of political order begin with the perspective that state institutions set limits on the legitimate use of violence and so control the violent tendencies of an anarchic society. Yet state building is itself a deeply violent process. Moreover the state continues to be a prolific user of violence. Aside from the obvious case of war between states, both democratic and authoritarian states engage in varying levels of everyday violence. In some cases, this violence is perceived as legitimate, as in the use of imprisonment as a punishment for criminal activity. In other cases, states transgress norms of legitimate violence, engaging in activities such as torture, sexual violence, and even ethnic cleansing. This course will cover topics including state building, torture, civil war, and crime and punishment. We will read work from political science, political economy, political sociology and political theory. This is a reading intensive seminar.",

Critical, social, post-structuralist, post-colonial and \u2018post-modern\u2019 interventions drew attention to structures and practices of meaning-making and to the relationship between knowledge paradigms and power. Interpretivist scholars made substantial contributions to developments in the theories of language and communication, and in the 'second order observation' involved in varieties of discourse analysis. Scholars across a variety of disciplines are working in interpretivist traditions that depart from the\u00a0 positivist paradigm adopted constructivist, thick descriptive, inductive and context-based approaches to assess, explain and understand sites and assemblages of \u2018meaning making\u2019. \u00a0\nThe aim of this course is to introduce students to the long tradition of Interpretivist Social Science, and to invite them to consider how its theoretical claims might inform their own epistemological and methodological decisions. The course offers practical training for students interested in modes of enquiry into the increasingly communicative, media driven, institutional and text based world in which we live that are not covered by conventional quantitative and qualitative approaches. In addition to equipping students with skills for interpretivist research design, data generation, analysis, inference, interpretation and critique, it addresses fundamental questions about the logic, conduct and significance of social scientific inquiry and the politics of knowledge in the 20th and 21st Centuries.",

            "description": "Indigenous peoples of Australia are the oldest living (surviving) culture in the world. In Australia, the Indigenous call for a \u2018Voice\u2019, Treaty and Truth-telling requires us to re-frame and reconstruct institutionalised governance systems, and to re-assert the legitimacy of Indigenous peoples' self-governance. Governance systems have often applied westernised models of \u2018good governance\u2019 to Indigenous communities in Australia, and globally. This course investigates the models and effectiveness of Indigenous-led governance systems, or in the Wiradjuri language, Biyam-burru-wa-la-nha:  'the rules of governing'. This course examines how these intersect with non-indigenous governance systems in Australia and in comparative jurisdictions such as Canada and Aotearoa-New Zealand. Looking at case-studies that include first contacts between First Peoples and colonial powers, and contemporary settings such as the Kimberley region, Western Australia and the Murray-Darling Basin in NSW, the course asks how do governance arrangements in particular settings facilitate Indigenous normative practices and community autonomy? How responsive are Indigenous and non-Indigenous governance systems to international norms, principles and laws?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis interdisciplinary Indigenous-led course draws on Indigenous standpoints, Indigenous ontology and epistemology, critical Indigenous theory, Indigenous rule of laws, comparative law, public policy, law, regulation, domestic and international law. It provides students with practical skills and intellectual insight to understand and develop Indigenous-centred methodologies to: evaluate the relevance and purpose of Indigenous-led governance systems and to facilitate respectful, effective relationships with Indigenous Australia.\n",

The key feature is that science dialogue is bi-directional -\u00a0information and insights are gained on both 'sides'. In the case of dialogue between scientists or science communicators and members of the public, then, the public participants learn about the science and the scientists' aims and aspirations, and the scientists learn something from the public, about their concerns and aspirations and generally about the social context of the science, which informs their thinking, and potentially their decisions, about that science. Dialogue has a special place within science communication as a communication medium with particular aims that is increasingly being promoted as a best practice approach within government and community sectors.\n\nThis course is co-taught with undergraduate students but assessed separately.",

However, in the sciences, we cannot afford to be so blas\u00e9. The ramifications of poor risk assessment (and communication) in science can and do have dramatic, global consequences. Risk is very hard to calculate, and even harder to communicate. What is risky, to whom, and why? How is risk understood by experts? How does it manifest in public domains? When does a risk become acceptable? Is it possible to speak about \u201creal\u201d or \u201ctrue\u201d risks in science? How do the concepts of risk and ethics relate?\n\u00a0\nIn recent years, issues such as climate change, environmental degradation and gene/ nano-technologies have regularly highlighted the need for society to challenge and address risks and ethics in the sciences. In this course, the practice and application of science is analyzed from risk communication and ethical perspectives. Consideration is given to how social, political and psychological contexts of scientific research influence contemporary debates about risk and ethics. The concept of ethical research is analyzed and critiqued and the communication of risk and uncertainty with lay publics is examined in detail. Throughout the course, significant attention is devoted to the consideration of clear and effective ways to characterize and communicate controversial, risky, and ethically charged science-based matters in the public sphere.\n\nThis course is co-taught with undergraduate students but assessed separately.",

Can we draw connections between things like eighteenth century British amateur science and citizen science today, or nineteenth century French science popularisation and today's science journalism? Can we identify histories of science communication-type practices for knowledge systems across the world beyond Western science, such as Australian Indigenous ecological and astronomical knowledges, Chinese engineering techniques or Islamic world mathematical methods? And how important is communication to these scientific traditions? Is science communication an added extra in the world of science, or integral to its success and longevity? How can we map institutional relationships between science and the bodies that promote it, popularise it, and link it to political processes? Thinking globally, how was 'modern science' made, in all these ways?\nThis course applies historical and institutional approaches to science communication to explore the big picture view of how this discipline and its professional practices have developed across the world and through time. You will map the relationships between science and the science communication-type activities and organisations that have always surrounded and supported western science as an institutionalised pursuit - scientific societies, advocacy for science funding, science professionalisation measures, science popularisation efforts of different kinds, science museums and centres, and more. You will also look at communication practices in knowledge systems beyond the modern West to develop long term, cross-cultural histories of science communication.

This has arisen because traditional scientific training programs rarely teach the skill set and competencies required to operate effectively at this interface.\u00a0Thus, this course focuses on providing students with the theory, as well as the practical knowledge, skills and tools that are needed to operate more effectively at the science-policy-practice interface to achieve tangible impacts from their research. This will be achieved by drawing on current research from the fields of knowledge exchange and research impact, as well as the inclusion of guest lecturers from the realms of policy and practice so that students gain a first hand account of the practical ways in which they can bridge the gap between science, policy and practice.\u00a0\u00a0",

Part I sets out first principles of ethical behaviour according to the National Statement of Ethical Conduct in Human Research, as developed by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). A brief overview of (a) ethical approaches; (b) ethical controversies, and (c) processes of research governance and ethical review, and\u00a0common antagonisms between researchers and HRECs, is also offered. Part II adopts a narrow-and-deep focus by examining ethical considerations to specific types of participants (eg., Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples; children and young people, etc)\n\u00a0\nThe course is largely applied in nature (research led problem-based learning), and seeks to complement related research methods courses offered in the Master of Social Research degree, and courses taught in other ANU colleges.",

And yet, we know very little about how surveillance operates and how the data these systems produce are used to positively and negatively structure our social experiences, in terms of how we are viewed and responded to by other actors and agencies. Personal data are a means of knowledge and power and they are put to many different ends, from governing large populations to staging individual constructions of identity.\n\nThis course considers some of the key historical events, organisational aspirations and cultural factors responsible for the emergence of surveillance societies. Students will learn about the political, social, legal and ethical dimensions and implications of mass surveillance, specifically by drawing on some of the major theories in surveillance studies. We explore the interests and values underpinning the expansion of surveillance, the types of regulatory frameworks governing surveillance and the complex forms of social relations mediating surveillance processes. We will focus on various research examples to develop our knowledge and understanding of the social drivers and implications of surveillance.\n\nThe four main questions informing our coverage are:\n1. What social and historical circumstances have generated the surveillance society?\n2. How did mass surveillance of everyday life become so normal?\n3. What purposes and interests does surveillance serve?\n4. How does surveillance operate and with what social consequences?",

            "description": "This research-led course provides an introduction to recent developments in Random Matrix Theory and Online Learning that addresses the challenges and opportunities posed by the availability of large amounts of data.\n \n In the first instance, we will review some classic results from multivariate statistical theory, matrix analysis, and probability theory. Then we will present the salient statistical features of big data (e.g., heterogeneity, noise accumulation, spurious correlation, and incidental endogeneity) and show how this impacts on traditional statistical methods and theory.\n \n We follow with an introduction to modern Random Matrix theory and its application in statistics. Applications presented may include topics such as high-dimensional statistical inference, large covariance matrices, large-scale statistical learning through subsampling, sparsification of large matrices, principal component analysis, and dimension reduction.\n \n We conclude with an introduction to the theory of online learning (aka. sequential prediction) to handle the situation of streaming data.\n \n Students will use and learn about the latest computational tools to work with big and streaming data sets. Example data sets may be drawn from areas such finance, web analytics, digital marketing, and satellite imagery data.",

Some of the topics that may be considered are: regularisation and dimension reduction, clustering and classification, non-independent data, and causality. Emphasis is placed on methodological understanding, empirical applications, as well as theoretical foundations to a certain degree. As the extensive use of statistical software is integral to modern data analysis, there will be a strong computing component in this course.",

And the third is to explore some concepts and ideas that can help us understand power politics better. The study of power politics is central to any study of strategy, but it is especially interesting and important in Asia today, because Asia is right now in the throes of a major power-political revolution as a radical change in the distribution of wealth and power overtakes the old order and forces the creation of a new one. We will explore this process closely in the course, by looking at how key regional powers are trying to position themselves in the new order of the Asian Century, and how their interests and aims interact with one another in the regional strategic system.",

This course echoes this ancient and enduring conception to analyse the use of military power to achieve strategic objectives, with a focus on the links between political intent and military action. It explores the nature and character of war, the characteristics of land, sea and air power, and how they might be used to achieve policy ends. In doing so it will examine the pitfalls and risks of military endeavour, the possible benefits, and what military forces can and cannot do. It will also consider the relationship between strategy, operations and tactics, the challenge of political-military relationships, military command systems and how militaries plan operations. Of interest to those seeking better understanding of force as an implement of national policy, the course is particularly appropriate for students considering government service or other positions involving national and international security matters.",

From week seven onward, the course applies this knowledge to an intensive strategy development exercise, in which students are charged with developing a US grand strategy for the Asia Pacific region. Students will develop grand strategies in small groups and then test their strategies in detailed, interactive simulation exercises against a range of long-term future scenarios.

Australia is no less in need of understanding the interactions of science and technology with policy. This understanding includes the evidence S&T can provide to underpin policy, and the areas where science and technology could influence the directions of Australia in the absence of effective policy.\n\nThis course provides a comprehensive approach to exploring the interactions between science, technology and public policy across a suite of policy areas. It is built on a novel teaching collaboration between two ANU Colleges (Asia and the Pacific; and Science), bringing together expertise from the Crawford School of Public Policy and the Australian National Centre for Public Awareness of Science (CPAS). \n\nIt will be interactive, and every session will use policy experts along with academic staff to ensure relevance and depth in the analyses. The course will be flexible, and arranged to maximise access by students who may be either full or part-time. It will consist of two 6-unit components; the first will be a prerequisite for the second. The first 6 units will be split between sessions exploring theoretical and practical underpinnings of how science, technology and public policy are undertaken and case studies exploring how these underpinnings play out, and might need to be revised, in real-world public policy situations. The second 6 units will consist entirely of case studies of increasing complexity as students hone their skills in extracting lessons and developing deeper understanding from examples presented by experienced academics and practitioners of public policy.\n\nStudents will be allowed to take its first 6 units or the full 12 units as contributions towards a postgraduate qualification, the 12 unit option contributing to a Science, Technology and Public Policy specialization.",

This course is the first in the world to combine Allied, Japanese and Pacific Islander understandings of the Pacific War with particular attention to the South West Pacific. It complements the existing emphasis on the perspective from the United States and is distinctive in making 'space' for Islander experiences. Attention is divided equally between a narrative history of the events of conflict, and a multi-thematic consideration of the consequences and implications of World War II in the Islands. These legacies are addressed through issues as diverse as military technology and strategy, health and environment, Pacific Island lives and post-war political developments in the region. The course offers a fresh approach to a watershed in regional history, and should appeal to students in History, Peace and Conflict Studies, Pacific Studies, Asian Studies, Development Studies and International Relations.",
