The rise of Rome from a tiny agricultural community on the banks of the Tiber River in central Italy to an imperial power dominating the Mediterranean region from Spain to Syria and from Gaul (France) to North Africa is a story that continues to fascinate and provoke debates over origins and causes. This course will trace Rome's evolution as a city-state, its conquest and domination of the Italian peninsula, and its conquest of lands overseas, including its disruption of the Hellenistic kingdoms, into which the empire of Alexander the Great had broken after his death, and its destruction of the Kingdom of Macedon, from which the empire of Alexander, and his father Philip II, began.",

Each of the disciplines shares a core concern with cultural identity, difference and change across time and space, in both material and nonmaterial worlds. They deploy a wide range of theoretical frameworks and methodologies (fieldwork, lab work, data analysis) that in many ways bridge the divide between the humanities, the social sciences and the physical sciences. In introducing students to ways in which the three disciplines approach Nature and Culture, the course will build on the two overarching themes of Body and Environment. Within these, students will investigate key topics  and case studies around bipedality, foodways, totemism, migration, archaeological tourism and more. Although materials and methods differ between disciplines, the challenge of the Anthropocene makes it more critical than ever to understand the past, present and future of our societies, and what it is that makes us human. This course provides a unique cross disciplinary perspective on these vital questions.",

Beginning with some of the things that are closest and most familiar to us - including the clothes on our backs - we're going to start at the ground and trace upwards the links that attach us to far off countries, economies, sites of production and\u00a0 fellow humans. In this way, we will trace our own map of the world system and get some sort of critical understanding of how we slot into it. In the process, we will ask 'Is there a more ethical way for us to approach some of those core global practices in which we all participate: consumption, tourism, inhabiting the city, and using the internet and social media?' How, in this immensely complex context, are we to be good global citizens?In the process of doing this we will learn the fundamental concepts anthropologists and other social scientists use to make sense of globalisation's exciting new cultural and social forms and its not so exciting new forms of exploitation and inequality. The focus will be on understanding the language of the anthropology of globalisation, and the practical and critical application of its key concepts to real life global issues. We will use an innovative team based learning approach in which students help each other workshop the weekly readings and carry out critical and interpretive activities in class based on real life case studies.",

The aim of this course is to convey a basic anthropological understanding of the customary or \u2018traditional\u2019 practices and beliefs as they were at the threshold of colonisation and to critically engage with representations while respecting First Peoples' insights and perspectives. We will focus on relationality, and in particular the multiple ways in which connectivity underpins Indigenous worldviews. Exploring these issues also means exploring the intellectual struggles non-Indigenous people have had and continue to have to come to terms with Indigenous societies and cultures, as well as understanding why and how Indigenous social and cultural practices capture the scholarly imagination.\u00a0",

Topics explored include: the saliency of the categories man and woman; the relationships between race and gender; the role of colonialism and neocolonialism in the representation of gender, sex and sexuality; the usefulness of the notion of oppression; the relationship between cultural conceptions of personhood and cultural conceptions of gender; and the ethnocentricity of the concepts of gender, sex and sexuality themselves. To assist these explorations we will make use of cross-cultural case studies in a number of areas including rape, prostitution, work and domesticity, the third sex and homosexuality.",

This course on applied anthropology will explore those methods. In short, we ask what it means to be an ethnographer beyond the lecture halls of the university? What does ethnography have to offer non-profits, advocacy groups, government agencies, design teams and corporations? How to be an applied anthropologist? This course is a practicum that will offer students the opportunity to answer these questions through hands-on projects. Over the course of the semester we will survey and apply a broad range of anthropological methods. This course is structured as a practicum, emphasizing learning by doing. Each student will follow one project for the whole semester. Tutorial will involve sharing, debating, and brainstorming applied anthropology in real world contexts.",

Crossing Borders covers the core theories and key case studies students will need to make sense of the complex terrain of contemporary international and domestic migration, both voluntary and forced. Beginning with a focus on international migration from developing to developed nations, we ask:*Why do people migrate?*Why do they go where they do?*What are their experiences of resettlement, work and community in their new host nations?*How do migrant communities form distinctive identities as a result of their migration experiences?*How do host nations react to flows of legal and informal migrants in terms of policy and in terms of ideologically driven responses?*How do host nation policies and social ideologies, especially around race, shape processes of migrant and refugee identity formation?*What relationships do contemporary international migrants maintain with their homelands?We then move to a focus on labour migration, both international and domestic, in developing nation contexts. Here we take a special focus on feminised labour migration for factory and domestic work in Asia and the Middle East. In this context, we enquire:*What experiences of marginalisation and exploitation do female labour migrants experience in host nations and cities?*How do they negotiate and resist harsh labour regimes and gendered and racist stereotyping?*What kinds of long-distance family relationships come into existence as a result of the migration of these women?*How do 'cash, communications and care' circulate in transnational families?*What development effects might the economic and social remittances sent by labour migrants back to home communities have?In terms of teaching approach, the course emphasis will be on understanding and mastering the language and theoretical tools used in the anthropology of migration, and the practical and critical application of\u00a0 key course concepts to real life migration experiences. We will use an innovative team based learning approach in which students help each other workshop the weekly readings and carry out critical and interpretive activities in class based on empirical case studies of migration.\u00a0",

Considering violence from an anthropological perspective foregrounds concerns of meaning, representation and symbolism\u2014understanding violence as expression as much as instrument. We will be approaching violence as usually meaningful and always culturally mediated, a phenomenon that is not outside the realm of human society.\nA key theme to be explored is the contention that violence, rather than necessarily signifying a breakdown in social existence, often plays a part\u2014perhaps even a fundamental one\u2014in the maintenance or creation of particular forms of social order. To this end, we will be concerned with analysing not only the explicit acts of bodily harm that occur in violent conflict but more subtle forms of violence perpetrated by the nation\u2013state and global institutions. In this sense, a vital aspect of the course involves engaging with the \u2018anthropology of state practices\u2019 through considering the relation of state and society as this shapes occurrences and expressions of violence.\nFinally, we consider the relation of anthropology and anthropologists to debates about universal human rights and reflect on the position of the anthropologist in witnessing, theorising and writing about violence, as well as the methodological challenges, ethical dilemmas, dangers and responsibilities involved.",

These are two different but related aspects of our approach to `states\u2019 in this course: conceptual and ethnographic, both necessary and important to relate to each other. We will examine concepts, and look at examples of practices and processes in a number of significant domains, in order to comprehend states, in their variety, in a distinctively anthropological manner. Most of our central readings are by anthropologists, and involve the relating to each other of concepts and ethnography. Central topics through which we will look at this conjunction will include everyday practices; culture and state ritual; law and regulation; personhood and agency; hidden and overt mechanisms of power; and persistent structures and emergent forms. Along the way we look at examples of some of the rubrics currently most often applied to states: the `stable\u2019 state; the `would-be\u2019 state (`Islamic state\u2019?), the `failed\u2019 state. Ethnographically, we will especially (but not exclusively) focus on what are considered developing states, by which is meant here: those which offer fewer entitlements and have penetrated less completely into the daily lives of their citizens, than is customary in the state systems of better-off countries. Thus the course is for students of the social sciences and related areas of practice such as development studies and social research.",

            "description": "Over the last forty years, a global discourse of indigeneity and indigenous peoples has emerged, originating and diffusing in the 1980s and onwards from particular nation-states. This internationalist concept of indigeneity had been centered in the United Nations, and enshrined in documents of other multilateral organisations (the World Bank, International Labor Organisation). Peoples now often regarded as `indigenous\u2019 have long existed \u2013 but this category is relatively recent, as are many developments associated with it.Like other such global discourses (e.g. `nationalism\u2019), how indigeneity is understood varies across particular contexts. Its global dissemination makes such variability inevitable, and the question of how it intersects with particular socio-economic-political conjunctures, essential. Generally speaking, indigenous-settler dynamics (such as are found in Australia, North America, New Zealand, and parts of Latin America) have been, in some respects, most receptive of the collective, internationally-authored, `indigenous\u2019 socio-political identity. For example, Australia as a state accepts the notion that it is home to `indigenous\u2019 people. The recent concept of indigeneity has been seen as more ambiguous, unsettling, or downright threatening, hence less acceptable, in many Asian, East and South Asian, as well as African countries. This course will examine the intersections of international concept and national circumstances, both conceptually and by case studies.This course will look at questions of the emergence of an internationalist global category from two principal directions underpinned by readings from anthropological theorists on: the reification of cultural constructs, capitalist constructions of meaning, and the exercise of powers of recognition and legitimation, the changing role of nation-states globally (Bourdieu, Foucault, Wolf); and more political-economically situated ideas concerning the current global conjuncture, how and why this particular kind of internationalist category has emerged and its intersection with what Kalb (2009) calls `\u201ccritical junctions\u201d that link global process via particular national arenas and local histories, often hidden, to emergent and situated events and narratives\u2026\u2019Students will work through a number of case studies of indigenous peoples and settings; and discuss what has happened in various cases, the extent to which the category `indigenous\u2019 has been mobilized concerning and by particular groups, and consider what the future of this category of `indigeneity\u2019 may be.\u00a0",

Anthropology offers a set of methodological tools and theoretically informed questions to understand how culture is represented and made meaningful in the world today. This course on applied anthropology will explore those methods. In short, we ask what it means to be an ethnographer beyond the lecture halls of the university? What does ethnography have to offer non-profits, advocacy groups, government agencies, design teams and corporations? How to be an applied anthropologist? This course is a practicum that will offer students the opportunity to answer these questions through hands-on projects. Over the course of the semester we will survey and apply a broad range of anthropological methods. This course is structured as a practicum, emphasizing learning by doing. Each student will follow one project for the whole semester. Tutorial will involve sharing, debating, and brainstorming applied anthropology in real world contexts.",

It does so by tracing the development of anthropological theory through the twentieth century, and with reference to its intellectual origins. The course begins by locating anthropology in its contemporary post-colonial context with an examination of critical perspectives on the history of the discipline, and explores the challenge of reading the past from the perspective of the present. It then moves from a consideration of the emergence of 'society' and'the social' as objects of study, outlines and assesses key aspects of functionalist, structural-functionalist, and structuralist approaches, explores the influence of Marxism and practice theory, examines key aspects of interpretive and symbolic anthropology, and ends with an examination of the implications of globalisation and the post-representational turn for the doing and writing of ethnography.",

Regional chronocultural sequences will also be analyzed in detail. Finally, we will round out the course by addressing a variety of themes including the evolution of socio-political complexity, religious architecture, funerary practices, settlement patterns, subsistence practices, human-ecosystem interactions within island environments, and material culture and technology.

Much of what we know of the deeper past comes from natural archives of changing cultural landscapes and environment. In Australia and the Asia-Pacific region there is a rich body of evidence for past changes in culture, climate, landscape and biodiversity that is only just beginning to be explored. The evidence for critical transitions that have occurred in nature and society will be discussed and students will see first-hand examples of how environmental change has influenced past and present societies and cultures. The course combines in-class learning, museum visits and fieldtrips to Mt Fuji and the ANU's coastal campus (Kioloa Coastal Campus).

The main emphasis in this course is the development of competency and familiarization with a range of practical skills associated with excavation driven archaeological research; particularly excavation, recording and post-excavation analysis. While the emphasis is on these 3 aspects of archaeology, students will also be introduced to a range of other archaeological skills such as mapping, survey, site location, assessment, sorting, artefact analysis and inventorying. Given the stress on practical skill development, this intensive field-based takes place on a &lsquo;real&rsquo; archaeological site that is important in elucidating aspects of the ancient past in thePhilippines.\n\u00a0\n*While the venue, and country, may change from year to year, the fundamental structure and content of the course will not change.\n\u00a0\nThe cost of the course will be charged directly to students.

However, the human management of animal and plant species, as well as anthropic alteration of habitats, has a much greater time depth. Domestication is usually associated with food production, especially different forms of agriculture. Domesticates facilitated the expansion and intensification of cultivation and animal husbandry through time, thereby enabling the rapid growth of many human societies.

Whereas the dominant discourse of art history from a Euro-American perspective tends to consign non-western modernist art to a marginal status and treats it as derivative, this course argues that modernism in particular Asian countries follows trajectories that are regionally specific and culturally diverse, responding to political, technological and social transformations. At the same time, the course addresses the complex interrelations between these non-western modernisms and the development of Euro-American modernism.\n\nConcentrating on a century of artistic practices from the later nineteenth century onwards, the course will offer students an introduction to visual practices, historical approaches and theoretical formulations relating to this material. Colonial and postcolonial histories of art, as well as relations between art practice and nationhood will form the core of the inquiry.",

Topics may include: Two Decades of American Painting (1967) The Field exhibition and its legacy (1968) and Kaldor Art Projects (1969 onwards).\u00a0The political context for these exhibitions will also be discussed, particularly in relation to the purchase of Blue Poles by the NGA in 1973 and the promotion of American art internationally during the Cold War period. Through an examination of the relationship between exhibitions and theory, the second part of the course will focus upon developments in performance art, womens art, conceptual art and environmental art. The course will provide a vital introduction to American-Australian art and theory from the 1940's onwards.",

The course will also address how the meaning of the artworks changed over time, for example, in relation to contemporary First Nations re-evaluation, repatriation and reception of historical works. Finally, you will be provided with knowledge of best practice concerning collaboration between non-Indigenous and First Nations artists and curators. You will experience works first hand through visits to the national galleries and museums, and will listen to both First Nations and non-Indigenous voices as part of this course.",

Each week students are presented with different tasks and approaches to seeing and drawing the human body by identifying space, shape, form, line, gesture, expression, movement, colour, tone and composition. The experience of drawing is broadened by testing a variety of drawing mediums and techniques through haptic exploration. In class students build up a substantial portfolio of work for assessment. A deeper knowledge of drawing in context of historical and contemporary art and design practices is furthered through weekly tutorial slide presentations and critical reflections. Additional weekly activities also assist students to demonstrate progressive development and gain confidence through guided drawing projects.",

Rather than focusing on strategies for producing traditional  'pictures' on a wall, this course explores how images are objects which can be touched, exchanged, exhibited, archived and distributed in different ways. Students will undertake a series of projects which will help them to experiment with different methods of photo-installation, paying attention to questions of tactility, immersion and spectatorship. Studio briefs will encourage experimentation with different types of formats and processes, and introduce historical and theoretical approaches to still and moving images in material culture. A range of contemporary practitioners and their methodologies will be examined, in order to explore advanced exhibition and distribution strategies.",

At the same time, artists are working with photography in new ways: large-scale photographic prints and installations and public interventions have replaced the small, enframed prints which populated Gallery walls only a few decades ago. This course will explore a range of methodological, political and aesthetic issues arising from these shifts in image culture. Through a series of practical projects, students will work the dynamics of visibility and size in photography from the pixel to the gigapixel, and the logistics of exhibiting large scale photographic works - from the print to screen. Students will engage in a process of investigation, and will individually research the contexts and concepts relevant to their projects.",

This kind of art practice sets up a constructed situation as a framework in which participants have, or are intended to have, agency in the production of the work. The experimental nature of the construction of situations does not determine what the artwork is in advance of its audience. It is constituted by the dialogue or interaction that the situation elicits. The course will centre on student-led projects developed within specific contexts, which will require context-specific research and knowledge acquisition. These projects will not necessarily be undertaken individually, and the way in which students become involved in each other's projects will be an important exercise in negotiating different roles. Social practice is also becoming an important form of outreach for museums and so the projects will address the future implications of this as well as situating their methods in relation to the history of dialogue and participation in art practice.",

The way contemporary artists engage in history making is to question given formats and representational conventions, exposing their latent power and reworking them. The production of histories is intimately entwined with the generation of possible futures and this course explores the political responsibility of artistic-historical narratives and their agency in transmitting and shaping the digestion of the stories they tell. Each student will undertake research into a specific (probably local) history, using methods from relevant disciplines, which could include ethnographic methods like participant observation or historiographic methods like oral history, archival and textual research, but could also include archaeological methods like surveying and excavating. Students will research the methods and media that are most appropriate to the history they are working on, and then educate themselves on how to go about using these methods and media within their capabilities and the resources available to them. The conceptual design and the realization of each of the students' projects will be informed by analysis of a various contemporary art projects which engage in the politics of memory and their approach to formats like the visual essay, the voice-over, re-enactment, the edited interview, archival display, and the monument. Although the media students work with is dependent on the conceptual development of their projects, the course will include some technical instruction on video production, post-production and installation.",

But automation is accompanied by accidents and this course will review the history of the accident from ancient Greece into the present. By intervening in social, environmental and technological systems, probing contemporary forms of automation and accident, we will develop a deeper understanding of what autonomy means for artists now and how to engage systems without being instrumentalised by them.",

The course offers a feel for the way individuals and communities live their lives and find different ways to navigate the currents, aspirations, and crises that have shaped Asia and the Pacific. We will explore key themes, such as the organization of life in politics, families, and language; the effect of poverty and riches; the importance of race, ethnicity and gender; and the power of belief, creativity and performance. The course will introduce you to many different ways of thinking about these themes, such as those found in political science, history, anthropology, archaeology, gender studies, economics, cultural studies, linguistics and other disciplines. Experts from across the ANU will raise big questions and case studies in lectures, while tutorials will help you hone your skills of critical thinking and effective communication.This course is one of two required foundational courses for the Bachelor of Asian Studies degree. It is also highly suitable for students from other programs who would like to learn the basics of understanding the Asia-Pacific region, and assists them in gaining what is sometimes called \"Asia literacy,\" a valuable attribute in any career in the 21st century.\u00a0",

As a culture that conceived of the ability to write poetry and prose as the distinctive characteristic of its elites, China boasts one of the largest and most diverse bodies of literature in the world. Since Western classifications of literature hardly suit Chinese typologies, the course approaches traditional Chinese literature according to its own generic classifications, using them as a guideline while tracing their modification and growth through time.Aside from receiving an overview of certain periods, authors, and genres, students will also study a wide variety of examples of literature in translation. Not only will they investigate the formal attributes that may qualify a text to be part of a particular genre; they will also engage reflectively with the backgrounds, contents, structures, meanings and intentions of the presented works. The aim of the course is therefore to enable students to understand and reproduce the major developments and genres of traditional Chinese literature as well as to classify works, previously unknown to them, according to genres.",

While the course refers to key concepts of International Relations, it also incorporates recent work in International History, which critically examines these concepts. It also stresses the transnational networks of people and ideas, as well as the meaning of historical memory in international relations of the region.",

Understanding how a map was produced, who, why, and what for, can provide a remarkable insight into how a group of people view themselves, their connections to other people, and what they consider important. Being able to interpret, use, and even create your own map are key skills for us to understand these factors, successfully use a map for our own goals, and to communicate such information to others.\nThis course will consider maps and mapping both as a subject to investigate and as a concise means of presenting research results. Focusing on the region of Asia and the Pacific, we will explore the history of maps, how different cultures utilise and present maps differently, and what these maps can tell us about how different people viewed the region at different times. This exploration will provide students with experience accessing the wealth of resources available for using and researching modern and historical maps of Asia and the Pacific. We will also explore the techniques and tools needed to make your own maps.",

Even after the collapse of the major historic imperial powers during the second half of the twentieth century, the legacies of those empires continue to shape contemporary life. And historians and political analysts still talk in terms of - and seek to redefine - imperialism in reference to present polities.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChina is central to such discourses on imperial power: it offers a particularly rich body of historical evidence for the practice of empire. This introductory course will therefore assess that evidence and survey the great drama of Chinese attempts to bring under single control and preserve the unity of its vast territories, so varied ethnically, culturally, and geographically. It will take in the full sweep of China\u2019s imperial past: it will start in the third century BC, when the foundations of the imperial system were consolidated; it will reach into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when encounters with Western powers forced a radical reappraisal of the Chinese imperial system. Dividing this broad chronological scope into three periods - early China, medieval China, and late imperial China - it will offer a sense of larger changes and continuities over time. Within each period, it will bring into sharp focus the social, cultural, and political arenas in which Chinese empire was developed and maintained.",

An understanding of the foundations of Chinese thought helps us to make explicit and self-conscious some of the radically different assumptions of Western intellectual traditions.

            "description": "This course provides students with the conceptual and analytical tools they need to develop a deeper understanding of politics in contemporary Asia. Through the framework of comparative politics, it will take on several major themes including democratization, identity politics, corruption, and development. In ordinary language, comparisons are often implicit, and arguments are based on weak evidence or poor logic. In this course, students will master not just facts and figures, but a sophisticated approach to analysis that can be used in the study of politics not just of countries in Asia but around the world. The twin thrusts of this course will be learning how to evaluate key concepts in political science (e.g. democracy), and learning how to draw valid causal inferences from comparative political analysis. Students will thus develop the skills to critically evaluate causal claims made in academic, policy, and journalistic writing. The course will be structured by first introducing students to key theoretical and comparative works on selected themes and then applying the approaches comparatively across and within countries in Asia. At the end of the course, students will have a \u00a0greater understanding of political events in Asia and have better understood why it matters for us to think about the region comparatively.\u00a0",

In doing so, the course measures each country's level of electoral competitiveness, political rights and civil liberties. Subsequently, we will analyse non-democratic regimes in Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Burma and Singapore), and discuss how these states instrumentalise elections in order to gain popular legitimacy. In approaching its subject, the course also analyses the socio-political environment of democratic and authoritarian rule in Southeast Asian states, discussing in particular the role of the media, social inequality, and gender issues. The primary objective of the course is to provide students with a solid understanding of the various types of political regimes that exist in Southeast Asia, and advance their knowledge about the complex relationship between democracy, elections and civil liberties, both in the Southeast Asian region and other parts of the world.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "description": "\u00a0\u201cHad I been born Chinese, I would have been a calligrapher, not a painter.\u201d said Pablo Picasso. Why was calligraphy so attractive to him? Why has the art of writing lines become so appealing? Chinese calligraphy certainly is a \u201csecond to none\u201d art form, and is without doubt the most important form of art in Chinese history. In daily and academic lives, Chinese words/characters are not only for embodying meaning, but also for various purposes of cultural expression, such as writing, artistic performing, religion, aesthetics and philosophy, social life and \u201ctempering personality\u201d. In fact, it is rare to find any Chinese literati without the ability to function in this art in earlier historical periods. Therefore, it can be said that Chinese culture truly is a filled \u201cculture of words.\u201dAdditionally, Chinese history is closely reflected in the long development of Chinese characters, which has evolved into different styles. It creates a set of delicate and profound Chinese aesthetic theory, which echoes Chinese art theory and philosophy, such as \u201cthe vacuity vs. substance\u201d (or \u201cthe empty/illusionary\u201d vs. \u201cthe real/full/solid/the substance\u201d), and loose vs. density, or the dialectical relationship between\u201cblackness vs. whiteness\u201d (or the black line vs. the white space). Chinese calligraphy can also be said to be a unique abstract art through linear expression. In Taiwan, Mainland China, Korea and Japan, postgraduate degrees in calligraphy are offered in Chinese or art departments. Learning and knowing Chinese calligraphy as such is necessary for all Chinese studies, especially those wanting an advanced understanding about Chinese history and culture.This course provides students with a general, yet profound, introduction to Chinese calligraphy. Through practice and knowledge acquirement, such as holding a brush, writing and knowing the knowledge of the \"four treasures\u201d, students can experience this ancient Chinese art and cultivate an interest for Chinese culture. As simplified Chinese has gradually become a dominant trend nowadays, traditional Chinese nevertheless is still a genuine access point to Chinese culture and Sinology in terms of its history, aesthetics and philosophy and literati circles. Simplified vs. traditional characters also reflects in different Chinese societies, namely Mainland China and Taiwan. Students will learn how to write and appreciate this \u201cart of lines,\u201d accompanied by the knowledge of its history and theory.",

Yet simultaneous to our study of rights violations, we will also study new the new strategies of redress that have emerged, including the growth of human rights organisations and transitional justice processes and the development of linkages between international and local organisations.

            "description": "Violent conflicts over natural resources are an enduring feature of social and political life at different scales and levels of organisation. The inter-state and geopolitical dimensions of conflicts over resources such as oil and water loom large in the popular imaginary. However, resource conflicts in the global South are predominantly fought internally, within the boundaries of the nation-state. Indeed, according to the United Nations, at least 40 percent of internal conflicts globally are related to natural resources. It is these sorts of conflicts that are the focus of this course.A striking conundrum lies at the heart of the inquiry: rather than\u00a0 contributing to peace and prosperity, empirical research demonstrates that natural resource wealth increases the likelihood that a country will experience internal armed conflict. How and why is this the case? What about the role of resource scarcity as driver of violent conflict in developing-country contexts? What sort of policy responses and interventions are available? How might natural resource wealth contribute to peace rather than to conflict? What is the role of political and economic contestation in these struggles over land and natural resources?The course will be structured around a series of case studies drawn from Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. A political ecology framework will be applied to the analysis of how land and different types of resource complexes\u00a0 - including mining, oil and gas, forestry, and oil palm - can be implicated in violent conflict. Alongside these case studies, students will undertake their own analysis of a natural resource conflict in which they will be attentive to the role of different actors - especially the state, communities and corporations - and to questions of scale, power and identity.The course will have a very strong research-led approach to teaching and learning. In addition to core expertise housed in SSGM, it draws upon expertise from other parts of the Coral Bell School and the Crawford School. In addition to the involvement of some of these scholars in class room teaching, the assessment for the course will enable students to engage with them in innovative ways.",

Asia and the Pacific forms the most linguistically diverse area in the world, and past and present societies across the two regions are typically identified by the kind of languages they speak. The course explores the status and internal diversity of a number of different language groupings, including language families such as Sino-Tibetan, Austroasiatic, Tai-Kadai and Austronesian, linguistic areas such as India and Mainland Southeast Asia languages whose historical connections remain debated, such as Japanese and Korean. It considers what language histories can tell us about the non-linguistic histories of Asia-Pacific societies. The course aims to introduce students to the basic principles and methods of historical linguistics, including processes of language change and language contact, as well as the ways in which linguistic development reflects socio-cultural change. We will use language history as a starting point for broader discussions that incorporate research from anthropology, archaeology and population genetics, asking how the different disciplines tell similar or different stories about the Asia-Pacific past.\nIn this \u2018L\u2019 version of ASIA2308, students will engage with readings and complete written assessment in the language they are studying.

As the nation with the fourth-largest population in the world, and as the third-largest democracy, Indonesia rightly aspires to expand its influence and have a greater say in international affairs. But both its foreign policy and its regional and international security policy have often been criticised as insufficient to achieve this goal. What, then, have been the hurdles to Indonesia's development into a key diplomatic and security actor? What have successive Indonesian presidents done to overcome these obstacles and increase Indonesia's international weight? How do Indonesia's neighbours, including Australia, view Indonesia's foreign and security potential, and its limitations? What is the most likely trajectory of Indonesia's foreign and security role in the decades ahead? How has the COVID-19 pandemic, which hit the country hard, influenced this trajectory? \n In this course, we will investigate the questions outlined above, and evaluate Indonesia's status in the web of regional powers in the Asia-Pacific region. In doing so, we will also reflect on key theoretical and conceptual questions in regards to the sources of a country's diplomatic and strategic power. Indonesia, with its quickly growing economy but continuously weak military, is a highly suitable case study for investigations into what exactly constitutes political and security influence in today's global security system.\u00a0  ",

Proponents throughout the world, including Australia and the Asia-Pacific, point to it as a solution to an array of problems. Critics for their part lambast it as neocolonial and exploitative. In this course, we cover the ground between these poles by turning to the rule of law in its particulars, through study of its relationship to colonialism and post-colonialism in Asia, Australia and beyond. By bringing together extractive colonial and settler colonial cases we aim to identify similarities and differences in the experience of colonialism and the rule of law, and query both the idea of the rule of law as preeminent political ideal for our time as well as contrariwise positions that treat it as nothing other than a fig leaf for colonial domination and oppression. Importantly, we will also look at the continuing legacy of colonial legal and political histories, and the relationship of the rule of law to political and social crises in our time.\u00a0\n\nBy taking an historical and cultural approach to the rule of law, we will expand and deepen our understanding of these regions' pasts and present day conditions, as well as adopt an empirically informed perspective on how and why the rule of law is so pervasive. Students will gain new insights into legal history and colonial power in a wide variety of places, including but not limited to Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Singapore, as well as through regional organisations. They will also consider in detail how the interaction between colonialism and the rule of law in Australia is at once distinct from and similar to that of the country\u2019s regional neighbours.\u00a0\n\nThis course is jointly taught in the College of Asia and the Pacific and the ANU College of Law. The Department of Political and Social Change is offering the course for students enrolled in the Bachelor of Asian Studies and in Bachelor of Arts in the College of Arts and Social Sciences, and in the ANU Law School for students enrolled in LLB and JD programs. The course will also be open to students in the Bachelor of Arts, and we expect interest from students doing the sociology, politics, development studies and human rights majors in particular. The course is deliberately interdisciplinary in its contents, modes of instruction and methods. It draws on a rich comparative socio-legal, anthropological, sociological and political scientific literature that in recent years has delivered an impressive range of studies on the rule of law in different colonial times and places, and work that ties the empirical contents of the course to overarching concepts of legality, authority and power.",

In so doing, this course is divided into two major parts: first, we will examine transnational historic processes which are themselves transgressive of state boundaries, and second, we will look at the ways in which borders themselves are mobilized as part of the state's assertion of sovereignty over geography, however incomplete this might be. In addition to assigned readings and two short essays, students will complete an independent research paper on a topic of their own choosing. ",

It uses the anthropological lens to bring technology alive, as it is encountered in everyday life by people and institutions. The course begins with an examination of key institutions in India: its social system and cultural practices. It draws on the history and ethnography of South Asia, and the major concepts that framed the discipline of anthropology, as inseparable from the colonialism in Asia. The first part of the course will \u00a0primarily focus on the foundations of Indian society, its social, cultural and political make up, before moving to main part of the course which focuses on technology.\nThe second part of the course investigates the multiple effects of technological schemes and innovation in India and their implications for social life. What do we mean by technology? What is the relationship between technology and social order and cultural values? How has technology, as part of India\u2019s embrace of economic reforms, reshaped society and the politics of identity? What is the role of the state and private enterprise in promoting technological innovations? These are some of the question we will cover.\nThe final part of the course will focus on the effects of neoliberalism on both private and public spheres, in promoting policies and ideologies that continue to be key drivers in shaping ideologies and everyday practices in India and its vast diaspora. While the course will focus primarily on India, readings and classes will also cover aspects related to other countries in South Asia.",

Asia\u2019s burgeoning aspirational middle classes, rapid urbanisation, the expansion of participatory democracy and the shift from command economies to de-regulated markets have had profound effects on people\u2019s everyday lives and the diverse cultural practices that have long shaped local livelihoods and community expectations. This course offers an introduction into anthropological approaches to the study of culture, modernity and globalisation in Asia. Relevant themes that have attracted anthropological interest include changing traditions and popular culture, adaptive custom and cosmopolitanism, migration and citizenship, identity politics and social movements as well as distinctive and emergent forms of governance in both collective and self-cultivating forms of expression. Drawing on a rich corpus of social theory and ethnographic research from anthropologists past and present, the course will provide students with conceptual and analytical tools to appreciate adaptive cultural practices in comparative terms, to review and appreciate the key anthropological debates and influential works in the study of modernity, and to introduce students to ethnographic approaches for researching and writing on modernity and contemporary ethnographies of global connection.",

Thus the main aim is to problematise the relationship between text and genre and issues of translation (across language, history and culture). We will consider how particular texts work and how best they can be categorized in terms of genre.

Asia and the Pacific forms the most linguistically diverse area in the world, and past and present societies across the two regions are typically identified by the kind of languages they speak. The course explores the status and internal diversity of a number of different language groupings, including language families such as Sino-Tibetan, Austroasiatic, Tai-Kadai and Austronesian, linguistic areas such as India and Mainland Southeast Asia languages whose historical connections remain debated, such as Japanese and Korean. It considers what language histories can tell us about the non-linguistic histories of Asia-Pacific societies. The course aims to introduce students to the basic principles and methods of historical linguistics, including processes of language change and language contact, as well as the ways in which linguistic development reflects socio-cultural change. We will use language history as a starting point for broader discussions that incorporate research from anthropology, archaeology and population genetics, asking how the different disciplines tell similar or different stories about the Asia-Pacific past.",

Students will be introduced to key interdisciplinary tools and approaches from the field of gender and cultural studies. Considering how these ideas have been theorised in Asian and Pacific contexts as well as in Western ones, the course engages in debates about feminism, imperialism and decolonisation, systems of gendered violence, same-sex sexualities, changing masculinities, and cross-cultural encounters. The course investigates how gender and culture inform the soft power strategies of national governments, the political and social norms underpinning health and medicine, and the ways Asian and Pacific societies face and respond to environmental crisis. A distinctive feature of this course is that students are asked to apply their conceptual understandings of gender and cultural studies in innovative ways through multimedia projects (no prior experience needed). Through analytical, practice-based and creative assessments, students will gain crucial tools to engage with the politics of everyday life in Asia and the Pacific.\u00a0",

This course consists of three major sections: human-machine relationships, aviation labor, and finally aviation consumers/passengers. Drawing upon engineering history and human-machine relationships, but considering these via social geography and anthropology, this course will discuss how aviation developed in relation to other forms of transportation and surveillance, as well as how \u201chuman factors\u201d discourses are used to assess aviation disasters. Next, it will examine aviation labour, taking on board theory and approaches from gender studies: from the highly sexualised, sometimes Orientalised icon of the flight attendant. Who is Singapore Girl? What does she represent? How do Thai Airways flight attendants use Buddhist philosophy to cope with the stresses of their job? Finally, the consumers of aviation: passengers and cargo. How has the container revolution changed our tastes in foods? How have the demographics of the flying public changed? How have marketing strategies and loyalty programs sought to segment elites? Following a general history of the industry and selected case studies from the Asia-Pacific, this course will explore the histories, laws, economies and cultures as they come together in the machines, labour, and consumers that form the aviation industry today.",

In the middle of the 20th century, in the aftermath of the Second World War, policy-makers became aware that the terms of peace could have a powerful impact on the likelihood of return to conflict. Significant progress has been made in developing peace-making processes that undercut the original causes of conflict and which thus diminish the possibility that conflict will recur. Architectures of international cooperation and inter-dependence also work to diminish the possibility of war.\u00a0\nThe historical memory of conflict, however, has proven to be a serious and intractable obstacle to international harmony. The historical bitterness that afflicts Japan\u2019s relations with Korea and China is greater now than at any time since the Second World War. Ancient antagonisms pit Cambodia against its two neighbours, Thailand and Vietnam. The memory of the massacre of communists in Indonesia 50 years ago looms as an issue in contemporary Indonesian politics.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, formal and informal reconciliation process in various countries of the region (including Korea, Cambodia and East Timor) have shed light on possible paths to preventing the legacies of bitter histories from causing ongoing conflict.\nThis course will critically analyse the processes used in dealing with the past, as well as the prospects and challenges for cooperation and reconciliation.\u00a0\n\u00a0",

Students will learn how to manage a dynamic environment of \u2018digital Asia\u2019, harnessing the creative and participatory possibilities of today's Internet. The course will encourage critical reflection on the interlocking logistical, ethical, gendered, cultural and political considerations faced by Asian people on a daily basis. The developments in the region confirm that Asia literacy and digital literacy are two phenomena that are not distinct from each other, but in fact closely interrelated.\u00a0\nThis course will prepare students for careers in the rapidly evolving digital spaces that are opening up in the Asian region and beyond, but also to provide a grounding of gender and culture as central to understanding how these digital spaces have evolved, and where they are heading next. Students will also be able to produce work for Monsoon, an Asia-Pacific focused online magazine based at the College of Asia and the Pacific, and to discuss new ideas and initiatives around the digital space within CAP.\u00a0\u00a0",

It is also currently in the midst of major transformations. Developments in the region, including the rise of China and ongoing efforts to resolve the crisis created by the last remaining corner of the Cold War - the division of the Korean Peninsula - have global implications. Meanwhile, the countries of the region are gradually moving towards the creation of closer regional integration. In order to understand these developments, and their profound implications for Australia and the rest of the world, we need to understand the historical, cultural and social context in which they occur. This course offers a new look at Northeast Asia. Key themes addressed include: the legacies of the Asia-Pacific and Korean Wars; the Cold War architecture of Northeast Asia; migration and cultural interactions between the countries of the regions in the Cold War and post-Cold War eras; the Korean Peninsula and Taiwan questions and their implications for relations between the countries of the region; and contemporary political and social issues in the region. This course will help students to develop their research skills, through finding and interpreting historical sources, current data and visual material on Northeast Asia.\u00a0",

The China that is growing in confidence and power, and with which Australia\u2019s present and future are inextricably bound, is a product of powerful social and cultural forces that demand explanation but resist analysis from a single point of view.\nThis course approaches contemporary China through the lenses of different disciplines and styles of analysis. It assesses such topics as the varieties of Chinese modernity, the nature of political power and regulation, protest and resistance, legal reform and human rights, the relationships between the urban and the rural, gender and sexuality, indigeneity and ethnicity, the flourishing of religion and the decline of ideology, and the contested understandings of China\u2019s history that critique or provide the foundations for contemporary policy and practice, implicitly and explicitly.\u00a0\nThis course is framed by the annual China Story Yearbook series, which collects and shapes Chinese contemporary stories from multiple voices and different perspectives under an annual theme. As such, the course takes as its overarching focus the theme of the current Yearbook. Students will address that theme through the various topics set out in the course structure.\u00a0",

Topics covered include popular culture, gender and religious identity, urbanisation, digitalisation, migration, climate change, decentralisation, cosmopolitanism, historical memories and much more. Students learn not only about the facts and figures of nation-states in the region today, but also 'how' their modern identity is being debated and constructed, and how it has changed over time.

Such a study of India, by facilitating the study of cultural interactions through the prism of different configurations of truth and falsity, rather than the prism of power, will also encourage students to think more broadly and deeply about the interplay between notions of truth.",

Students can nominate to undertake disciplinary studies in English, as well as language studies or disciplinary studies in their target language.Global Semester is a variable unit course, so it can accommodate a breakdown of disciplinary or language studies to count towards Asia Pacific Studies majors, minors or electives, or it can accommodate partial credit if students are nominating to split their semester exchange program across two degrees.Students can apply to undertake Global Semester at any ANU exchange partner throughout the world. However, students undertaking a semester of exchange at an ANU exchange partner in Asia may wish to enrol in the Semester in Asia course. A full list of ANU exchange partners can be found at: http://students.anu.edu.au/think/global.phpAs part of the application process, students will be asked to outline how the proposed study at the ANU exchange partner will count towards the majors, minors and/or electives in their ANU degree(s).\u00a0",

Students are introduced to the global wars which shape history on grand scales and to the local conflicts that persist in the background. We want to know: Why do we fight? What is conflict? Is conflict sometimes good? Who are insurgents? What is terrorism? How do we maintain memories of conflict? Is future conflict inevitable? We explore big questions through political science, strategic studies, international relations, anthropology, history, law, gender studies and psychology lenses. These specific disciplinary orientations, infused by insights from Asian and European traditions of thought, offer their own answers in the study of peace and conflict. Our approach in this course is integrative, interrogative and critical. We analyse the causes of war and conflict; the nature of security and strategic decision-making; the political drivers of international and sub-national conflicts; the use of technologies and tactics; and the public presentation of war and conflict. The regional orientation of this course\u2014reflecting the Australian National University's strengths\u2014is the Asia-Pacific region. The questions that we examine find some of their answers in East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Pacific. To provide students with a robust foundation for further study, this course draws on the range of expertise that makes ANU the hub for the critical analysis of the big questions concerning war and conflict. It is appropriate for those who wish to develop knowledge of specific situations of peace and conflict, as well as for students who hope for a broad overview of the topic.This course will be taught in Japan (in English) as part of the Bachelor of Asia Pacific Affairs.",

We investigate colonisation, the impact it had and still has on the region, and the different ways it can be understood. In the recent present we examine the new voyages that Pacific people have taken into places like Australia, New Zealand and the United States. In doing so we look at how people move within and between these new boundaries and how Pacific cultures and identities have evolved over time and place. Finally, we bring all of these themes together by examining how the past and the present can help us imagine the future.This course will be taught in Japan (in English) as part of the Bachelor of Asia Pacific Affairs.",

The region is on the frontlines of climate change, encompassing the countries most vulnerable to sea level rise and natural disasters in the world, yet it is also a site of pioneering forms of climate adaptability and resilience.\n \n The Pacific is, and has always been, an important area for Australia\u2019s interests. The Australian Constitution sets out the special relationship, specifically mentioning relations with the islands of the Pacific as part of parliament\u2019s mandate. Today, with a fast-growing Pacific population in Australia and a renewed interest in the region as a site of geopolitical importance, this relationship remains significant.\n \n The course examines the domestic and regional politics of the contemporary Pacific, and the important developmental challenges facing the region. It is based on case studies from cutting-edge research conducted by Pacific experts at the ANU.

What alternative security arrangements might Australia seek as the relative strategic weight of its American ally declines in the face of Asia's rise? How might Australia compensate for the fact that it might no longer be able to maintain a clear military technological edge over many of its increasingly prosperous Southeast Asian neighbours?

            "description": "All primates (non-human and human) have the capacity for flexible biological responses to environmental change. Due to the wide range of environments in which primate species are found this flexibility often results in extreme adaptability in diet and food intake. This course looks at this dietary flexibility and how it may impact or limit nutritional intake across time and space and in turn how this may impact issues of health and population viability. Using both cross-species and cross-cultural comparative approaches this course will specifically explore how nutrition relates to disease dynamics and health in various physical environments across all primates, both extinct and extant. The main sections of the course will include exploring the adequacy of different diets, issues of both malnutrition and overnutrition, and the impact of nutrition for reproduction and growth in both juvenile and adolescent periods. It will also consider how changing environments alter nutritional intakes to potentially impact population health in new ways. Finally, it will consider the methodological challenges of studying nutrition in living or dead primates (human and non- human) to highlight how this may affect our interpretations of the relationships we discuss throughout the course.",

Lectures cover a variety of topics including: morphology and distinguishing characteristics of each group of living primates; social organisation, mating, activity and diet as well as community ecology. Once lectures are complete, tutorial work will be done through the collection of behavioural data on primate groups at the National Zoo and Aquarium (NZA). Students will be trained in data collection and assigned a species of primate on which to collect behavioural data. This data will then be used to answer a research question based in one of the theories learned in lecture. Finally, theory and data will be put in the context of primate conservation and how we best conserve the world\u2019s primates.\u00a0",

It is about understanding how evolutionary biologists do research, and getting to grips with how we can design tests or experiments that tell us about processes that happen over timescales longer than a human life, or events that occurred millions of years ago. For example, how do we test ideas about why some birds are brightly coloured and others dull? How can we reconstruct the events that result in one species splitting into two? How can we explain why there are so many species in tropical rainforests? By the end of this course, you will be able to formulate and test your own evolutionary hypotheses.\n\u00a0\nA series of 4 workshops include in-depth discussions of the complexities of evolutionary issues, and a computer workshop to give you hands-on experience of evolutionary analysis.\n\nHonours Pathway Option (HPO):\nEntry to this option will be subject to approval by the course convener and is based on academic merit.

How does a goose fly over the Himalayas in the intense cold and low oxygen that would kill a human in minutes? Answers to these questions rely on a strong understanding of how plants and animals operate at all levels, from cells to organs. For an organism to function in the natural environment physiological processes must work together. If we understand these processes we can better predict how plants and animals will respond to environmental stress. For example, we can then work out how extreme temperatures and drought brought about by climate change will affect local rates of extinction. We can explore the tricks that allow some species to survive in seemingly inhospitable environments across our planet. This knowledge can offer novel engineering insights into the design of our own buildings, transport systems and even cities (biomimetics is a growing and exciting field).\n\u00a0\nPlant and animal systems are rich in their diversity and have evolved striking parallels in how hormones and other biomolecules interact in day-to-day life. These interactions govern all metabolic processes that affect growth and performance. In this course we will help you to see both the shared and unique features of plant and animal physiology that underpin the evolution of biodiversity.\n\u00a0\nPhysiology is not just fascinating; it\u2019s crucial to our survival and well-being. Students will learn concepts that can be applied to an array of real-world problems including: 1) predicting how species distributions will change in response to climate change; 2) improving conservation outcomes for endangered plants and animals; 3) how anthropogenic stressors, such as overfishing, pollution and the introduction of invasive species impact physiology and can increase the risk of population extinction; 4) designing crops to ensure future food security.\n\u00a0\nThis course covers a broad range of topics that can be studied at greater depth in more specialised third year courses\n\nHonours pathway option(HPO):\nEntry to this option will be subject to the approval of the course convener and based on merit.\u00a0Students who take this option can choose to complete one of the two additional assessable item:\n1500 word essay on a topic relevant to the course that would be supplied by the lecturers together with some seed research literature.

These are the big questions ecology addresses.\n\u00a0\nThis course will focus on quantifying how interactions between individuals and their environment shape populations, and how populations of one species are, in turn, affected by other species. The core principles governing ecological interactions are universal, applying at scales ranging from the microscopic (e.g., bacteria and viruses) to those of ecosystems surrounding us. They play out over timescales ranging from minutes to millions of years. They apply to both natural and managed environments. By understanding and quantifying ecological interaction we can make models describing the past and predicting what will happen in the future. This way of thinking is particularly valuable today, as human behaviour drives the ecology around us, and we need to forecast the consequences of our actions.\n\u00a0\nThis course will take a hands-on data-driven approach, with field trips, workshops and discussions focused on illustrating key ecological concepts. We will leverage the power of the R programming language to visualise data, whether empirical, or simulated by our mathematical models. One course highlight is a three-day field trip to the Kioloa Coastal Campus, that will allow you to design, carry out and analyse a small ecological study.",

Have you ever wondered why you are a similar height to your siblings - is it because of your genes, or because of the environment you grew up in? Why do traits vary even when their underlying DNA sequence is exactly the same? What role does genetics play in your risk of developing diseases such as diabetes?\n\nThis course will introduce you to the principles of population, evolutionary and quantitative genetics.

Understanding these cellular activities enables us to appreciate the normal functions of living cells, to explain the molecular basis of diseases and inspires the development of new treatments.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis course deals with the basic physiology of cells and the origins of disease, with a particular emphasis on membrane transport processes. \u00a0The proteins that control entry and exit to the cell provide the fundamental interface between cells and their surroundings, controlling such things as the electrical excitability of nerves, the secretion of hormones and the uptake of drugs. This course will cover the following topics: cell and membrane structure and function; membrane channels and transporters and their roles in nutrient uptake, ion homeostasis, cell signalling and drug resistance; the electrical properties of membranes; the cellular and molecular basis of the excitability of the nervous system; excitation-contraction coupling in muscle; signal transduction; the molecular structure and function of membrane transport proteins; the molecular basis of the action of a number of drugs; diseases involving transporter and channel defects. Specific examples include explaining the molecular origins of epilepsy and designing novel treatments for malaria.\n\u00a0\nStudents will comprehend how molecular processes give rise to cellular function, and gain the ability to apply this knowledge to explain the basis of a range of human diseases. The course is designed to provide skills to those wanting to apply their chemical knowledge as well as those anticipating a future career in medical sciences. Students will learn to analyse and synthesise data to produce testable hypotheses that they can communicate to others.\n\nHonours Pathway Option (HPO):  HPO options available and may vary from year to year.\u00a0Students should contact the course convener directly for HPO option.",

We do so by analysing numbers to reveal patterns, and then by designing experiments to exclude competing ideas that might explain what causes these patterns. In this course, you will discover how to design experiments and analyse data. You\u2019ll then be equipped to critically assess scientific claims that you hear in the media. Think about how much of the news is about alleged medical breakthroughs, causes of health problems, and claims that one economic policy is better than another. We want to help you to sift out fake news, identify misleading ways to describe data and allow you to assess the importance of\u00a0different factors in explaining the patterns we see in the world. This is a core life skill. And, naturally, if you take this course you\u2019ll be better equipped to take the path to becoming a biologist yourself.\n\u00a0\nThis course will explore the ways biologists design experiments, generate data and assess evidence using a variety of statistical techniques. We will discuss the value of different scientific approaches, including hypothesis-driven experiments and exploration of large-scale data generation\u2013such as genome and transcriptome sequencing projects. We\u2019ll consider examples from microbial, animal and plant biology, and you will carry out exercises to develop and test hypotheses, and critically interpret the results. You will have the opportunity to participate in all stages of a biological experiment. This will include the conception and design of a study, laboratory work, analysis of the data, drawing conclusions, writing the report and engaging graphical ways to present your findings. The R programming language will be taught and used throughout the course. Students will be required to use their laptop computers.\n\nHonours Pathway Option (HPO):  This course offers optional HPO and ASE add-ons for undergraduate students.\nHPO and ASE students will be required to demonstrate greater depth of understanding of the content of the course. They will undertake an independent or group inquiry-based research project. Students will be required to write and present report from the project. The project will include:\nliterature review,analysis and critical evaluation of research data, andpresentations of the research.\nThe fields of research will include:\ngenetics and genomics,epigenetics,biostatistics.\nEither add-on will count for 20% of the mark for enrolled students. In this case the regular course assessments (Assignments x3, Lab report, Mid-term quiz and Final Exam) will be scaled down to 80%.\nStudents participation in these options must be approved by the course convener.

While in tropical rainforests, they have evolved to deal with wet, often dark conditions where they rarely encounter other members of their own species. Finding suitable places to settle, grow and reproduce is a challenge. In both environments plants and animals have evolved special morphologies, physiologies and behaviours that influence the way they interact with other species, and that allow them deal with extreme conditions.\n\nIf you would like to conduct original field research on plants and animals in a beautiful field site, this intensive residential field course may be for you. Through directed research projects, conducted in small groups and led by field experts, we introduce students to field studies in plant and animal ecology. We explore the ways that diverse organisms respond to conditions in their environment and acquire the resources they need to survive, grow and reproduce: their functional ecology. The course location varies among years, but regardless of location the same theoretical principles will be explored in the context of protected area management, conservation and climate change. \n\u00a0\nBy exploring the functional ecology of plants and animals simultaneously, students develop an understanding of the differences and commonalities among organisms. Students develop skills in research including project design and execution, data analysis and interpretation, and oral and written presentation of results. Students will also be exposed to a wide array of field techniques used in ecophysiology and behavioural ecology. Our aim is to give participants a chance to do real science and to embrace being a scientist. The experience enables students to approach their later year studies with independence and a new perspective and will provide real-world skills relevant in both science and non-science careers.",

This is scientifically nonsense. But do you know why? Do you understand, for example, why the existence of worker ants and meerkats that help others breed is so hard to explain? The answers are found in behavioural ecology.\n\u00a0\nIn this course, we aim to understand how natural selection generates animals that are adapted to both their physical and social environment. We emphasize how to test evolutionary hypotheses about animal behaviour and performance. Our lectures are in five modules that cover key topics: the trade-off between survival and reproduction, the principles of animal communication, the evolution of cooperation, evolutionary arms races, and the perils of sex. We consider such questions as: How do animals balance the need to get food yet avoid predators? Can animals lie? Why are males usually bad parents?\u00a0Why don\u2019t parents produce only daughters? Why are animals choosy when mating? Why do lions cooperate to hunt? We also emphasise the importance of behavioural ecology to conservation. If we know the predictors of fitness for individuals, we can better predict population growth and responses to environmental change. Behavioural ecology therefore provides the holistic understanding needed for practical conservation. ANU has a word-class behavioural ecology group, and we include our current research alongside that carried out worldwide. Our overall aim is to help you develop a logical approach to understand and test any question in evolutionary biology.",

This course offers an overview of the biological and molecular bases of important parasitic diseases and an understanding of the enormous impact parasites have on endemic communities. \n\nIn this course we will take a broad and multi-disciplinary approach to the complex and dynamic relationships between parasites and their hosts. We aim to understand the problems we face when fighting parasitic diseases and to identify potential solutions. We will explore both unicellular parasites (protozoa) and multicellular parasites (mainly parasitic worms and ectoparasites). We will also investigate overarching themes like mechanisms that cause disease, transmission, diagnostics, drug development and intervention strategies. \n\nThe diverse and comprehensive lecture series is complemented by hands-on practicals that will emphasise particular aspects. These practicals will also provide insights into the current state of parasitological research and strategies that are employed to develop new drugs and diagnostics. ",

These are the fastest growing fields of biology and perhaps science. Bioinformatics is a rapidly growing scientific discipline at the interface of genomics, statistics and computer science that has distinct but overlapping aspects: the development of computational infrastructure (eg. algorithms, programs, databases) and their use to analyse a wide variety of biological data. Among these data, genes, transcripts and epigenetic features play a central role. Their rapid and large-scale acquisition in today's genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and other -omics projects poses the major challenge of modern biology. The large-scale and genome-wide analysis of these data relies on advances in bioinformatics and statistics. As computer literacy is central to genomic biology, it is also central to this course. Accordingly, the course includes short sections on computer programming using the Python and R programming languages. Topics covered will include techniques for sequence comparison, population and comparative genomics, and transcript analysis.\n\nHonours pathway option (HPO)\nThe HPO will be one of two different \"types\" of research related activities:\n Choose an \"issue\" (e.g. a feature request, or bug) from an open source bioinformatics project and solve it by writing code and tests.Choose a statistical method for analysis of genomic variation and critique it.\nBoth options would require regular meetings with the course convenor.",

What about the genes of a whole population? Should we let algorithms and artificial intelligence drive our cars, help us make decisions about who to hire, or help us decide who to imprison? Do we owe future generations a liveable planet? Should we seek to enhance human capabilities, such as our cognitive ability, our moral perceptions or our emotions?

Did the extinction of dinosaurs pave the way for the rise of mammals? What causes one species to diverge into two? Equally surprisingly to many people, it is possible to test \u201cbig-picture\u201d questions like these using a set of basic logical principles and analytical tools, and an ever-expanding database of molecular, geographic and ecological information on the world's species. The aim of this course is not to present you with facts to memorize, but to equip you with the skills to ask interesting questions about biodiversity, and develop creative and elegant ways to answer them. This is a challenging and rewarding course that requires students to think creatively, take charge of framing, investigating and answering questions, consider different viewpoints and come to their own opinions.

In the first half of the course we cover the enormous diversity of terrestrial, marine and aquatic invertebrate animals, from insects and spiders to molluscs, rotifers and corals. In the second half we cover the enigmatic Australian fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals, with a particular focus on their diversity and natural history. The course includes contributions from researchers at the CSIRO Australian National Insect Collection and the Australian National Wildlife Collection, both located in Canberra.\u00a0On a 3-day field trip to the coast you will gain a solid grounding in identifying the most common marine and terrestrial invertebrate fauna of south-eastern Australia and the habitats that they occupy. Lab practicals throughout the course focus on hands-on learning about key features of structures and how they function, specimen preservation and the use of biological keys for species identification. We have designed this course to complement other third year courses in ecology, evolution, biodiversity and conservation. It is fun, interesting and interactive.

While in tropical rainforests, they have evolved to deal with wet, often dark conditions where they rarely encounter other members of their own species. Finding suitable places to settle, grow and reproduce is a challenge. In both environments plants and animals have evolved special morphologies, physiologies and behaviours that influence the way they interact with other species, and that allow them deal with extreme conditions.\n\nIf you would like to conduct original field research on plants and animals in a beautiful field site, this intensive residential field course may be for you. The advanced version of this course is aimed at students who have completed 2000 level science courses and are interested to explore and develop an independent research project. Working with practitioners, students develop independent field research projects in plant and animal ecology. We explore the ways that diverse organisms respond to conditions in their environments and acquire the resources they need to survive, grow and reproduce: their functional ecology. The course location varies among years, but regardless of location the same theoretical principles will be explored in the context of protected area management, conservation and climate change. \n\u00a0\nBy exploring the functional ecology of plants and animals simultaneously, students develop an understanding of the differences and commonalities among organisms. Students develop skills in research including project design and execution, data analysis and interpretation, and oral and written presentation of results. Students will get to apply a wide array of field techniques used in ecophysiology and behavioural ecology. Students will also engage in supported peer mentoring and peer review processes. \n\u00a0\nOur aim is to give participants a chance to do real science and to embrace being an independent scientist. In addition to the hard research skills, we explore keys to effective collaboration and collegial interactions. The experience enables students to approach their later year studies with a new perspective and will provide real-world skills relevant in both science and non-science careers.\n\nThis is an Honours Pathway Course.\n\u00a0",

The landscape is littered with companies which have tried but failed miserably to take advantage of the supposed myriad of opportunities which a country of 1.3 billion persons represents. \nThis course aims to provide students with an understanding of the contemporary environment of business in China and an appreciation of some of the implications for firms seeking to undertake business there.\u00a0",

The course is aimed at significantly improving the ability of practicing managers to be effective global managers. The course is concerned with considering the issues and problems of managing in cross-cultural situations, in particular at the people problems that invariably arise in international business relationships. Failure on the part of managers to understand and deal with the difference in attitudes, values and behaviour of those with whom they interact in business transactions consistently has been shown to be a major source of difficulties. The course will involve marrying theories and concepts from the broad fields of culture and international business and applying them to problems typically confronted by managers involved in international business. The course will draw on the existing knowledge and expertise of the class participants to solve problems relevant to them and their organisations.\n\u00a0",

In addressing these issues particular attention is paid to the impact of financial reporting choices on the relation between reported earnings and firms\u2019 underlying economic performance. Valuation describes the methods by which our expectations of firms\u2019 future performance may be converted to a present day value of the firm\u2019s assets, and the various financial claims on those assets.

            "description": "Literary Chinese is a written language that matured long before the Qin dynasty (221-206 B.C.), when China first became an empire. It continued to be used by China's governing and elite cultures for nearly three millennia. A command of Literary Chinese is therefore indispensable for the study of any aspect of Chinese literature, thought, history, politics, or society before the twentieth century.The idioms, syntax, style, and allusions of Literary Chinese continue to pervade the modern language. Its enduring influence results from the fact that the great legacies of Chinese culture, right down to the present day, have been largely preserved in this medium. Contemporary Chinese political and social discourse, and education, places increasing emphasis on knowledge of pre-modern Chinese culture and on familiarity with texts written in Literary Chinese. So without a grounding in Literary Chinese, it is impossible to gain a full understanding of the language or content of newspaper articles, literary works, and scholarly prose written in contemporary Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the People's Republic of China. It has also shaped the linguistic and cultural traditions of Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.This course focuses on the analysis and translation of a selection of texts for beginners from the pre-Qin (before 221 BC) and Han (206 BC to 220 AD) periods. Students develop an understanding of the main grammatical forms, function words, and sentence patterns of this formative period of Literary Chinese. Students will also study techniques of translation, as well as the cultural backgrounds essential to understanding the texts at hand.",

Students learn the organization of programming languages using types, how programs are evaluated (reduction), functional composition, recursive functions, algebraic data types, pattern matching, parametric polymorphism, higher-order functions. Students also gain exposure to asymptotic analysis of basic data structures, abstract data types, modules, laziness, and streams. The functional paradigm demonstrates elegant solutions to many programming problems.\n\nThe course also introduces students to standard productivity tools for software development that will be used throughout the course and remainder of the computer science degree. These include distributed software revision control systems.\n\nThe Advanced version of this course covers these topics in more depth, allowing students to deepen their understanding and experience.",

Additionally, it introduces topics which cut across many computer systems, such as cross-layer communication and basic concurrency (as well as basic ideas of virtualization and efficiency through proximity).\nCPU architectures are discussed from first principles (digital logic) and are expanded into current day designs. This also involves assembler level programming to connect hardware circuits to the world of software. Representations of data types and high-level code at the machine level will be made clear by keeping the relations between high-level and machine-level code throughout the course. It will also look at how concurrent software constructs can or cannot be translated into parallel hardware operations.\nThis course will cover a wide range of topics such as digital logic: transistors, gates, and combinatorial circuits; clocks; registers and register banks; arithmetic-logic units; data representation: big-endian and littleendian integers; ones and twos complement arithmetic; signed and unsigned values; Von-Neumann architecture and bottleneck; instruction sets; RISC and CISC designs; instruction pipelines and stalls; rearranging code; memory and address spaces; physical and virtual memory; interleaving; page tables; memory caches; bus architecture; polling and interrupts; DMA; device programming; assembly language; optimizations; concurrency and parallelism; and data pipelining.\nKnowledge of the principles of networking and operating systems (as well as their relation to computer hardware) are essential for every computer scientist and this course will provide those foundations.\nThe relation of assembler level building blocks (macros) to constructs in direct compiled language is demonstrated throughout the course.\nWhile this course provides the above foundations (which stand on their own), it also prepares students for the follow-up course COMP2310 Systems, Networks and Concurrency, which rounds off the knowledge about concurrency in current computer systems of any scale, as well as expands the knowledge in networking and operating systems.",

It exposes the students to research skills, problem solving skills, team work and project management. Each student will work on a small-scale research project supervised by an academic researcher. A central part of the course will be a mock-conference to which all students will submit a paper to about their research. Students will anonymously review each others papers, respond to the reviews and submit a final version of their paper that considers reviewer comments. At the end of the course, students will give a talk about their research and present a poster. Throughout the course there will be meetings where students discuss all aspects of their projects, as well as a set of lectures about different aspects of being a successful researcher.\n\t\u00a0",

            "description": "\u201cProgramming languages are the medium through which we describe computations. More specifically, we use the model provided by a programming language to discuss concepts, formulate algorithms, and reason about problem solutions. Programming languages define models tailored to thinking about and solving problems in intended application areas. For example, the C language provides a model close to a computer\u2019s underlying hardware [\u2026]. The languages used in practice change continuously as advances in our field and the broadening uses of technology change how we model and express computation. At its core, the study of programming languages examines the principles and limitations of computing (or programming) models, the effective design and use of systems or languages based on these models, and methods to compare their relative strengths and weaknesses in particular contexts.\u201d [Why Undergraduates Should Learn the Principles of Programming Languages, ACM SIGPLAN Education Board, February 6, 2011, Page 1]\n\nThis course is an introduction to the theory and design of programming languages. To develop high-assurance software - software for which we can give strong evidence that the software will do what it is supposed to do and nothing more -\u00a0a formal description of the 'meaning' and behaviour of programs is required. Hence two fundamental aspects of the study of programming languages are their syntax, and their formal semantics. High-assurance software is not only needed for safety-critical software, but also for program transformations, such as carried out by optimising compilers.\n\nTopics covered in this course include formal semantics of programming languages (such as operational, denotational and axiomatic), type systems, higher-order functions and lambda calculus, concurrency, and communication.",

We consider the key issues associated with the identification and management of social problems and contemplate how behavioural disobedience, as a moral resource, is purposefully exploited for political and commercial ends. Using a set of case studies (or crime control 'controversies') as evidence, students will address the following key questions:\n  How are social problems defined and policed?  To what degree is public understanding of crime culturally mediated and influenced by specific rhetorics?  Which groups and interests effectively dictate crime control policies and criminal justice system agendas?  What are the social consequences of intensifications in criminalization processes and securitization projects?\nOverall, this course equips students with the appropriate knowledge, acuity and research skills to understand and engage the contemporary crime control landscape from a critically informed perspective.",

Drug use on the other hand is much less common but no less problematic, accounting for\u00a0between 20 and 40 percent of crimes committed in Australia. How we respond to these issues remains a matter of significant academic and policy debate - especially for those charged with the responsibility of promoting safety, both on the streets and in the home.\n\nThis course examines the social, legal and political responses to alcohol and drug use in contemporary Australian society. Students will explore their own perceptions of the drug-crime relationship and contrast these with the theoretical frameworks that currently exist to guide policy and practice. In particular, this course focuses heavily on current law enforcement and social policy responses to alcohol and drug related crime, examining existing policies and practices such as drug courts, treatment institutions, and early referral into treatment programs.",

We will contemplate how broader social, economic and political forces significantly shape the everyday administration of punishment and explore how criminal justice policies and programs differentially impact upon particular groups, ensuring their over-representation in prison facilities.

Diversity can be the result of not only internal dimensions (such as ethnicity, gender, and age) but also different historical, social, and institutional processes with each population encountering unique risks and needs. One of the most consistent finding in criminology is that minority populations are over-represented at all stages of the criminal justice process both as victims and offenders. Hence, one of the critical issues in criminology today is addressing inequality within the criminal justice system and how to best cater to the needs of such diversity. In this course, students will be introduced to theoretical understanding of marginalisation and inequalities within the criminal justice system. Students will explore current responses to diverse populations and examine ways to reduce inequality within the criminal justice system.

            "description": "In our increasingly computerised and networked society, designers and creative practitioners are faced with exciting new opportunities to incorporate computation into their production processes. Dynamic design embraces the constant change and variability of digital media, crafting flexible, interactive systems. Generative design takes up the potential of computing as a process, using rules and systems to create otherwise impossible physical and visual forms. The designed systems that result can give rise to endless variations in form and outcome, challenging traditional notions of design and object. To explore these ideas and opportunities, this course takes a practical, production-focused approach to computer-based generative techniques and design for dynamic content. It introduces skills and techniques with broad application which students may employ in image-making, visualisation, video and animation, interactive media, or 3D design for objects and structures.\u00a0",

The processes and practices considered involve designers imagining futures based on current technological and cultural trajectories; but rather than accepting those trajectories, design is used as an instrument to incite change and alter their direction.

The main focus of study will be on identifying and comparing the relative importance of those factors that appear to have hindered, or have promoted economic development in each of the three economies. Among the main themes to be explored are the roles of rural development and technology, peasant society and other cultural influences affecting economic growth, manufacturing industry and industrialisation, population growth, urbanisation, foreign influences, and economic systems. Analytical emphasis will be on identifying and comparing long-run determinants of each country's success (or the lack of it) in achieving economic growth and development.",

            "description": "Law and Economics applies the concepts and techniques of microeconomics to the law itself, focusing on the doctrines, rules and remedies of the common law: the dominant source of legal rules in Australia. The course does not assume any prior legal knowledge, nor does it provide any legal training.\nThe Course employs basic price theory \u2013 rational maximization, the law of demand, opportunity costs, and the idea that voluntary exchange allows resources to gravitate toward their highest- valued uses \u2013 to predict the consequences of legal rules: how they affect the behaviour of individuals and groups; and uses welfare economics to evaluate legal rules, especially their efficiency effects. Legal issues examined in the course include property rights, tort law, contract law, criminal law, law enforcement and punishment, litigation and settlement, product liability, pollution control, the interaction of tort law and insurance, principal-agent liability, and regulation v tort law as ways to control externalities.\nThe approach is non-technical, using the tools of Micro 1 to introduce one of the most exciting and vibrant fields of legal scholarship and applied economics. The emphasis in this course is on \u201cthinking like an economist\u201d to understand legal issues from an economic perspective, with a focus on a clear understanding of the logic and underlying economic intuition rather than just the results.\nLaw and Economics is designed for both economics and law students. For economics students, it is an interesting application of the economic way of thinking to real world problems and policy issues. Examining actual legal cases gives students experience in relating abstract economic models to practical problems and demonstrates their direct relevance.\nAlthough economics can help explain law, the influence of the law on the economy is far more important. Legal and political foundations underlie economic performance. The law is an important social institution and incentive structure that provides a foundation for the economic order and plays a central role in determining social outcomes, yet economists often take it for granted.\nUnderstanding law helps us better understand the workings of the economic system. Economic analysis rests on a bedrock of legal relations that law and economics explicitly analyses. Free markets do not exist within a vacuum, but need a legal framework that protects property, enforces contracts and allows free exchange to flourish. Law provides the framework in which firms and individuals decide on their actions in the economic sphere.\u00a0\nFor law students, Judge Richard Posner (one of the founders of law and economics) explains the benefits of law and economics well: \u201cThe law is divided into numerous fields, each of which has a complex structure of rules. The fields are traditionally studied in isolation from one another, and within each field the rules tend also to be studied as a separate, often self-enclosed bodies of thought. Yet it turns out that a relative handful of economic doctrines \u2013 such as decision under uncertainty, transactions costs, cost benefit analysis, risk aversion, and positive and negative externalities \u2013 can, by repeated application across fields of law and legal rules, describe a great deal of the legal system and enable the student to develop a more coherent sense of the system \u2013 to grasp the relation of its parts and understand its essential unity.\u201d\nThe \u2018economic approach\u2019 to law provides a unified vision of the law, tying together diverse areas of law into a common theoretical structure. The logic of the problems the law exists to solve is the same across all the standard fields, making it possible to understand a wide variety of legal issues in terms of one central set of interrelated concepts. Understanding the economics of property helps you understand torts and contracts, rather than treating them as isolated fields.\nThe important interdependencies between law and economics mean understanding law improves economic analysis and economic analysis is a useful tool for understanding law and for devising laws that improve society and economic performance.\nTextbook\nA.

Governments want to measure the impact of their policy changes on society as a whole, while private agents focus on the impact they have on their own welfare and the welfare of those they care about. In markets subject to tax and other distortions market prices are not normally reliable measures of the social valuation of goods and services. Thus, they cannot be used to evaluate the social impact of policy and other changes. Instead, we derive shadow prices of goods and services to look through market distortions and measure social valuations. When changes in economic activity are evaluated using these shadow prices they provide measures of the social impact of policy and other changes. This course summarises the information provided by different welfare measures for single consumers and then looks at ways to aggregate them over consumers. In doing so we examine ways to account for distributional effects in policy evaluation. Tax reform and the optimal provision of public goods are examined as applications of these shadow pricing rules.",

Growth rates of at least five of them have been among the highest in the world for various, extended periods since 1970. Second, three of them experienced a sudden and very sharp economic crisis in 1997-98, the causes and consequences of which remain contentious. Third, there is considerable diversity in the region, in terms of size, resource endowments, policy orientations, political history, and economic performance. Thus the region offers scope for development case studies not usually available through a single-country course offering. Fourth, they are increasingly important in the East Asian and international economy, as sources of trade and investment.\u00a0The purpose of this course is to provide a rigorous, analytically informed overview of these economies, with primary emphasis on the period after 1970. The six original ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member states, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam will form the core of the unit. Reference will also be made to the smaller Mekong economies.",

            "description": "\tGame theory provides a framework that helps to understand and analyse situations where many agents interact in a strategic setting, so that each agent\u2019s well-being depends on the behavior of the other agents. Game-theoretic techniques have been widely used in many sciences, and have been successfully applied in almost every field of economics, including macroeconomics, industrial organization, public economics, and many others. In addition, recent applications of game theory have yielded important insights in many other disciplines, such as political science, law, biology, finance, and computer science.\n\t\u00a0\n\tThe aim of this course is to introduce the main ideas of game theory at a level suitable for advanced later-year undergraduate students. The theory will be illustrated by way of examples and applications, which will primarily be drawn from economics and political science. While the level of the course will be introductory, and formal mathematical prerequisites are minimal, the presentation of the material will rely on precise definitions and models, as well as rigorous logical reasoning and analysis.",

It initially started by drawing experimental evidence and insights from psychology and other social sciences suggesting the\u00a0standard model of rational decision-making provides an inadequate description of behavior.

We will study\u00a0foundational topics in behavioral economics, with a focus on theories of behavior that aim to incorporate non-standard phenomena into classic economic models, with consideration of intertemporal decision-making, choice under uncertainty, and learning.\n\nThe course will be centered around research paper discussions, allowing students to develop the critical skills necessary to evaluate and put in practice the latest research findings in the field of Behavioral Economics.

Governments want to measure the impact of their policy changes on society as a whole, while private agents focus on the impact they have on their own welfare and the welfare of those they care about. In markets subject to tax and other distortions market prices are not normally reliable measures of the social valuation of goods and services. Thus, they cannot be used to evaluate the social impact of policy and other changes. Instead, we derive shadow prices of goods and services to look through market distortions and measure social valuations. When changes in economic activity are evaluated using these shadow prices they provide measures of the social impact of policy and other changes. This course summarises the information provided by different welfare measures for single consumers and then looks at ways to aggregate them over consumers. In doing so, we examine ways to account for distributional effects in policy evaluation. Tax reform and the optimal provision of public goods are examined as applications of these shadow pricing rules.\u00a0",

The course also covers topics on public choice and provides an alternative, more critical, view of government. The public choice perspective places more emphasis on modelling the political process and argues that this, like the market mechanism, has readily identifiable sources of failure.\u00a0",

The Course employs basic price theory - rational maximization, the law of demand, opportunity costs, and the idea that voluntary exchange allows resources to gravitate toward their highest- valued uses - to predict the consequences of legal rules: how they affect the behaviour of individuals and groups; and uses welfare economics to evaluate legal rules, especially their efficiency effects. Legal issues examined in the course include property rights, tort law, contract law, criminal law, law enforcement and punishment, litigation and settlement, principal-agent liability, and regulation v tort law as ways to control externalities. The emphasis in this course is on \u201cthinking like an economist\u201d to understand legal issues from an economic perspective, with a focus on a clear understanding of the logic and underlying economic intuition rather than just the results.\u00a0",

The course goes beyond the linear regression models used to estimate simple associations between dependent and independent variables. It covers nonlinear models used to analyse for example discrete and censored dependent variables, and it covers estimation of causal effects as opposed to associations. The necessary econometric theory will be covered/reviewed and numerous applications will be discussed. In addition, practical aspects of data analysis will be discussed using the software Stata.\u00a0",

Computer simulations are used to predict future climate changes, but these projections remain very uncertain and the capacity of climate models to reproduce long-term change needs to be thoroughly tested. The only way to do this is by testing model performance against geological archives of past climate changes.\nYou will examine how geoscientists reconstruct past climate changes combining data from the oceans, atmosphere, ice sheets, land surfaces, and vegetation, and how these relate to reconstructed changes in energy supply from the sun. One important topic that we will cover, for example, concerns the reasons for past atmospheric CO2 changes, and how these influenced the global climate, as well as conditions in the oceans.\nThe course covers the essential aspects needed for understanding the Earth's climate system such as Earth's energy balance; climate sensitivity; sea level and ice sheet changes; ocean circulation changes; nutrient cycling and atmospheric CO2 variations. These subjects are covered using marked events in Earth history. You will learn how the geochemistry of natural palaeoclimate archives and numerical models is used to reconstruct the history of the climate system and identify the causes of climate change. Geochemical tools and proxies, and geophysical methods, for reconstructing climate changes through Earth's history will be explained. You will learn how to use box models to understand nutrient cycling and atmospheric CO2 changes. We will look in more detail at: the nature of, and relationships between, high-resolution ice-core records from Greenland and Antarctica; abrupt climate changes; the factors that affect short-term climate variability in Australia and how these are currently changing; and the science related to common misconceptions in climate change discussions. A key outcome of this course will be a firm understanding of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that control Earth's climate, and how they may interact to modulate climate change in the future.\nIn addition to research-based lectures and practicals, journal articles of greater conceptual difficulty will be made available for students who wish to explore their personal interests in climate change. The teaching material is focused around areas of active palaeoclimate research and presents students with an overview of the latest international scientific understanding of past climate changes and their relevance to the future.\n\nHonours Pathway Option (HPO)\nAdditional readings of greater conceptual difficulty that require an advanced scientific understanding will be made available for students enrolled in the Honours Pathway Option (HPO). HPO students will be asked to answer additional and/or more challenging questions during exams.\n\u00a0",

However, many geologists have an incomplete understanding of the process, whilst there are many misconceptions about how it relates to surface processes. A broad background to the physics and fluid dynamics of mantle convection will be provided in this course, by explaining what it is, how it works, and how to quantify it in simple terms. It assumes no specialist background: mechanisms will be explained simply and the required basic physics will be fully reviewed and explained. The distinctive forms that convection takes within Earth's mantle will be described within the context of tectonic plates and mantle plumes, whilst the implications for geochemistry and Earth's tectonic evolution will be explored. Common misconceptions and controversies will be addressed, providing a straightforward, but rigorous, explanation of this key process. Emerging insights into the fundamental links between climate, surface processes (weathering, erosion and sediment transport), plate tectonics and underlying mantle flow will also be covered, thus providing a complete overview of Earth\u2019s dynamic engine.",

Core areas of study include seismology, geodynamics, geodesy and geophysical fluid dynamics. A variety of course work from these fields is on offer, in addition to a supervised research project worth 50% of the final mark. The goal of Physics of the Earth Honours is to gain a solid grounding in quantitative analysis of physical processes based on both theory and observation. For example, plate tectonics, in which distinct pieces of the rigid outer shell of the Earth constantly move and interact due to internal heating, manifests in seismic (e.g. earthquakes), geodetic (e.g. GPS displacement) and geodynamic (e.g. crustal deformation) observation. Evidence from these fields of study have been central to gaining a better understanding of convection within the Earth's mantle, and how the continents have shifted and deformed over time. More specifically, coursework will cover seismic wave propagation, earthquake source mechanisms and seismic imaging; fundamental concepts in fluid dynamics and their application to the Earth (e.g. Buoyancy driven flow in the ocean); sea level change and variations in polar ice cap volumes from satellite data; the physical behaviour of minerals and rocks at pressures and temperatures encountered deep within the Earth; and theory and numerical methods for solving geophysical inverse and data inference problems.",

Students will encounter a range of theories and methodologies for the study of production and reception which may include: book history, reception theory, the sociology of the book, publishing studies, and histories of reading, authorship and performance.",

            "description": "Cinematic adaptations of novels, short stories and plays have dominated the box office and film industry awards for some decades, often provoking fierce debate about their fidelity, or otherwise, to the original; discussions about how the\u00a0text has been transformed, cut and downright ruined, or, conversely, how the film has 'rescued' the novel, making it seem interesting and worth reading in a new context. The proliferation of YouTube, Facebook and multimodal adaptations in recent years has only reignited and reformulated these discussions.\nThis course examines a series of texts together with their adaptations on to different kinds of screens,\u00a0in order to understand the differences between novels, short stories, plays, film and other visual media as modes of storytelling; examine the way the written text and its adaptation participate in debates unique to their own historical contexts; and analyse the anxieties about literary and cultural value exposed by adaptations. We will ask: how do screen adaptations generate new meanings from literary texts today? Should an adaptation seek only to imitate the text or can it also transform, reconceptualise and critique it? What role do the market and the audience play in generating new meanings from texts? And can the relationship between text and adaptation be understood as mutually dependent?",

We will examine the ways in which knowledge of the period in which Austen wrote enriches our understanding of her fiction and how the novels in turn participate in certain crucial debates and developments of the period. Topics to be covered will include the representation within the novels of the following: the Navy, marriage and adultery, fashion and consumption, slavery and empire, the landed estate, Bath, the concept of 'improvement', the female reading public and its institutions, leisure, the Gothic, ideas of the family and domesticity, music, the theatre, female friendship, philanthropy and science.

We will do so through closely reading a selection of case studies, moving from the 1950s' 'I Love Lucy' through to 'The Simpsons', 'Twin Peaks' and to a contemporary film that is arguably inspired by contemporary televisual media (Richard Linklater's 'Boyhood'). In doing so, we will engage with some of the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries\u2019 most important theorists of television narrative (including Raymond Williams and Marshall McLuhan). Beginning with television\u2019s first emergence in the 1950s, we will consider the various ways in which television has been produced, transmitted and received. Our investigation will move from television's reliance on studio recording to thinking about the importance of live and cable broadcasting and, more recently, the role of digital devices that can stream or download content. We will ask questions about what makes televisual storytelling distinct and whether or not television has influenced the development of other forms (including novels and films). The course will conclude with our looking at how television has transformed in the contemporary era of so-called convergent or \u2018connexionist\u2019 media.\u00a0",

In this course we will read a variety of Victorian texts in the context of nineteenth-century anxieties and discourses about sexual transgression, gender roles, disease, madness, spiritualism, the experience of modernity and the problem of the body. We will read a range of literary forms including novels, novellas, short stories, plays and poetry, and both canonical and non-canonical texts, enabling us to understand the breadth of  Victorian writers' achievement and the way that Victorian literature both participated in and emerged from debates in other cultural discourses such as medicine, psychology, sociology and philosophy. The inclusion of texts from other areas of Europe, Australia and America may provide the opportunity to test the connotations and the limits of the term \"Victorian\" as a lens through which to study the output of this productive period.",

It introduces students to major research now undertaken that reflects the view that law is neither divorced from nor above the cultural forces and representations all around us. Whether as a lawyer, an activist, a politician, a writer, a diplomat, or a citizen, we face a global world whose enormous challenges will require of us the ability to understand the relationship between legal discourse and other discourses such as art, human rights and literature which responses to these challenges. Human rights offers a legal and moral framework that attempts to address experiences of injustice, suffering, and traumatic loss. To address these effectively we need to draw on a range of vocabularies and discourses, and be able to mediate between them\u2014to compare, contrast and evaluate their meanings and impacts. \u00a0In Literature Law and Human Rights, we study the representation, advocacy and critique of human rights in different genres, including their treatment in law and literature, including film and the visual arts. \u00a0Each of these forms of storytelling are devised to solicit strong reactions in an audience. Whether in Palestine, Africa, or Alice Springs, law, literature and human rights are different languages for expressing injustice and for demanding redress. \u00a0Each are powerful in their own way. A lawyer, an activist, a novelist, and a film-maker are all storytellers with specific means at their disposal, and specific goals in mind. But just what kinds of storytelling are they? How do they differ from one another, and how do they influence one another? \u00a0In what ways does literature (in the broadest sense) help organize our understanding of human rights, and mobilize legal responses? And on the other hand, in what ways does law constitute a literature of human rights, and with what consequences?",

Informed by this foundation, students will examine in turn 3 or 4 current topics in literary and cultural studies, each running over 2-3 weeks and paired with a primary text (a novel, play, film, case study etc.). Topics might include: new theories of reading, such as \u2018distant reading\u2019, \u2018surface reading\u2019, \u2018reparative reading\u2019 etc.; animal studies; ecocriticism; theories of performance; practice-led research; theories of affect and emotion; trauma studies; memory studies; neuroscience and \u2018plasticity\u2019; each taught by scholars focusing on these areas.The course will not provide a comprehensive overview, but an exciting and varied sample of current debates.

It first unveils the inner workings of a general-purpose microprocessor building up from simple logic circuits. It then demystifies assembly code\u2014the machine language spoken by the processor\u2014and the mapping of assembly programs to higher levels of programming abstraction. With an understanding of how the microprocessor executes programs, the course then shows how a high-level programming language such as C makes those abstractions concrete, and exposes the static and dynamic structures of programs. Students learn the organisation principles of a simple microprocessor, how it can be realised in a simulator, and programmed in assembly. Students also build a non-trivial real-world application in the C programming language.\n\nMore specifically, the course covers:\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Introduction to digital systems and logic, including Boolean algebra, logic gates, and combinational logic\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instruction set architecture (ISA) design principles with a specific focus on the ARM ISA\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Microarchitecture of a simple ARM processor\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Memory and I/O systems\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0C programming language, translation of C programs to ARM assembly, and C program runtime organization including call stack and heap\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Basic I/O utilities in C and memory mapped I/O\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Relationship between programming language abstractions and assembly code",

ED2 is the second course in the interdisciplinary engineering design core, which situates design within the life-cycle of systems. You will undertake a project using a systems approach to design, which is a formal process for generating robust and relevant engineering designs, applicable to all areas of engineering.\n\nDuring the early stages of the course, you will become fluent in the language of systems engineering for the purposes of describing a design problem space. This includes how to research and systematically generate requirements, undertake a functional analysis of a system, and create and communicate the architecture of an engineering design. You will develop skills for life-long learning by completing modules in a range of prototyping and modelling methods including visualisation, electronics and fabrication. These modules will supplement the systems approach to design, allowing you to represent an engineering design from both a systems and visual perspective.\n\nDesign Project\nThe major project in this course will involve a real-world engineering problem. You will be challenged in small teams to generate an engineering design using the systems approach that meets the requirements of project stakeholders in one of a range of application domain areas of systems engineering. You will apply research and design techniques to visualise, prototype and evaluate alternatives, in situations limited by available resources and imperfect information. During the project, you will develop design outcomes justified through project documentation. Finally, you will develop skills in critical reflection as a part of professional practice by connecting your experiences and learning in your project to engineering and research practice.\nEngineering Design @ ANU\n\nAt ANU, students are challenged to think of engineering design at a systems-level.

Also acceptable is 8 weeks in an engineering environment and remaining 4 weeks in any sort of employment. A variation of this scheme that may be acceptable in a handful of special cases is 4 weeks in any sort of employment, 4 weeks in employment in a technical industry of some kind and 4 weeks of work with engineers in an engineering environment. All work experience claimed must have been completed since the commencement of the degree.\n\nStudents are required to submit a 10-15 page report upon completion of their work experience.

Major developments are occurring in the energy sector, both with energy technologies and the economic, social and policy measures that accompany them. This course focuses on renewable energy resources - the technologies that will comprise a large part of global Energy Change. It aims to help students identify the major 'big picture' questions in the area of energy resources and develop technically sound ways of quantitatively answering them.\n\nThe course commences with an overview of world fossil-fuel energy resources, the scientific evidence\u00a0for climate change, and an introduction to asking good questions - with a focus on ball-park analysis and appropriate physical units.\n\nWe next look at individual renewable energy resources in detail (solar PV, nuclear, wind, solar thermal, hydro, bio, geothermal and tidal). We examine their scientific and technical foundations, available resources, integration with the grid, and broader economic and social issues to assess their ultimate potential as well as their practical limitations. Alongside the technical assessment of energy resources, we dedicate individual lectures to calculating the levelized cost of electricity, understanding the current and future electrical grid, and examining broader social and political issues concerned with energy use. Because of the rapid pace of change in this field, the course focuses on developing students' skills in framing questions and finding answers, as well as being able to critically evaluate those answers and support them with scientific evidence.",

Recent global and local assessments of biodiversity have reported deterioration of ecosystems and species loss, leading to potentially irreversible changes from baseline conditions. In the face of the challenges presented by multiple degrading processes, measuring and monitoring ecosystems is as important as ever. Ecosystem change may be manifest in an array of ecosystem attributes expressed as changes in number or size, or presence of species, functions, or services within an ecosystem. Despite the array of changes ecosystems may express, ecologists call upon the same broad concepts when designing and implementing approaches to quantitatively assess change and difference. This course aims to introduce the concepts at the core of measurement and monitoring for detection of ecosystem change.\n\nThis course aims to build on quantitative modelling skills using approaches that underpin the bulk of ecological studies. The intent is to provide the next step (after pre-requisite introductory courses) for students in building competence in widely applicable field-survey, data-handling and statistical methods. The ultimate aims are to provide an essential quantitative skill set for future researchers, managers, consultants, analysts, and policy-makers alike.\n\nThe dizzying array of attributes that may change in ecosystems means that the course cannot meaningfully cover a substantial number if ecosystems, attributes, or processes. The intensive timeline of the course, and uncertain public-health landscape, means we cannot travel to remote sites. The course focusses on local case studies that offer the opportunity to explore the use of data experimental sites as well as native ecosystems. While these case studies may seem, at times, distant from the idealised landscapes ecologists work in, they embody the basic question types that ecologists seek to answer when monitoring ecosystems in an approachable setting. They also support integration of lecture, workshop and reading material. Individual sessions will focus on specific examples of measurement and the impact of instrument selection and use; experimental design and implicit consequences; common and advanced analysis techniques",

Particular challenges for these nations were recognised in the 1984 Barbados Programme of Action for Small Island Developing States and in the 2014 SAMOA Pathway. These meetings recognised that Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have a narrow range of resources, which forces undue specialization; excessive dependence on international trade and hence vulnerability to global developments; relatively small watersheds and threatened supplies of fresh water; costly public administration and infrastructure, including transportation and communication; and limited institutional capacities and domestic markets, which are too small to provide significant scale economies.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe particular challenges faced by a Fiji as a SIDS will be explored in this course. The field trip aims to give students a first-hand experience of the real-world circumstances that confront an island nation by exploring important sectoral themes in the context of sustainable development.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe course will investigate the interactions between economic development and the sustainable management of key sectors including fisheries, agriculture, water catchment management, tourism, waste management, cultural heritage management and marine and coastal biodiversity. Within each theme students will consider factors relevant to island nations, including climate change, natural disasters, water availability, gender, cultural identity, population and race relations, governance and globalization.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe course will be undertaken in collaboration with the University of the South Pacific\u2019s Pacific Centre for Sustainable Development PACE-SD.\u00a0\u00a0",

However, bringing about such societal change is not easy, whether it be at the global, national or local level. This course considers the complex drivers behind societal change in pursuit of environmental objectives.\n\nUsing both global and local case studies, the course will break apart some of the crucial building blocks of modern society and explore how we understand the concepts of society, environment, and the economy and the complex relationships between them. The course will also look at who \u2018we\u2019 is and how different individuals and groups experience the environment and environmental change differently. From here the course will explore how societies can and do pursue change, the complex relationships which influence change, the different discourses represented in the global conversation about environmental and social issues, and the links between international environmental movements and local, domestic environmental outcomes. In particular, the course will address such questions as: What are the key factors for successful societal change? What are the barriers? How do we know we are addressing the most critical environmental issues? And how do we know when we have succeeded?\n\nHonours Pathway Option (HPO)\nSubject to the approval of the course convenor; HPO students will be required to demonstrate greater depth of understanding of the content of the course.

Students learn both the theories underpinning different PRM approaches, and practical skills such as group facilitation, stakeholder analysis and how to design and manage participatory processes. A series of guest speakers discuss recently-implemented Australian and international participatory processes, and the class evaluates the factors that affected the success or otherwise of these processes. The course assessment, much of which is based on group-work, is designed to ensure students apply the facilitation skills being taught, and that students can explore topics of particular interest to them in the field of PRM.",

This course investigates the use of broadly applicable ecological principles and methods to restore or sustainably manage woodland and forest ecosystems.\u00a0We begin with how desirable objectives for sustainable ecosystem management can be defined, particularly focusing on criteria and indicators, the adaptive management cycle and a precautionary approach. A range of examples including traditional silvicultural and other systems is used to explore how plant community structures and dynamics can be manipulated to achieve management objectives.\n\u00a0\nThe course uses a \u201chands-on\u201d approach to develop skills in the quantitative assessment, measurement and modelling techniques that are fundamental to assessing the state of an ecosystem. Field exercises are designed to provide experience in assessing whether applied management approaches are leading to the desired changes in system structure and dynamics. The field and applied focus of the course provides experience with the basic quantitative skills that are sought by employers of natural resource management and ecology graduates in areas ranging from hands-on management to policy. Students\u00a0apply their learning to a management planning task within the major assignment, and deliver the results of their work in a conference-style setting at the end of the semester. Smaller quizzes and reports throughout the course help develop skills to assess and interpret forest and woodland structures and conditions, and to develop solutions for multiple management objectives.\n\u00a0\nStudents may expect to interact with researchers and other professionals from the Fenner School of Environment and Society, Forests NSW, Greening Australia, and the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency.\n\u00a0\nHonours Pathway Option\nSubject to the approval of the course convener students taking this option must demonstrate greater depth in the philosophy and use of modelling for environmental/forest management.

The course considers how policy is made and the institutional settings within which it is made, how problems and policies are framed, implemented and evaluated, and the inherent challenges in choosing appropriate policy instruments to meet an objective. The course focuses particularly on Australia\u2019s public environmental policy and institutional settings. Comparisons with international case studies will be made. Interactive lectures and seminars provide students with opportunities to analyse specific environmental policy issues in theoretical frameworks and over different time scales. Once a general overview of how environmental policy is created we apply a structured analytical tool to assess whether existing environmental policies in Australia are adequate to meet the challenges of environmental management in a changing climate. Topics explored include water, forestry, biodiversity and climate policy, sustainability in business and industry, public and civil society participation in policy-making, and comparisons will be made with overseas environmental policy examples.\n",

In essence, palaeoecology enables us to venture back in time and reconstruct landscapes of the past, with much of our understanding of these deep time environmental histories based on the microscopic fossil remains of plants and animals found in sedimentary sequences. There is a rich body of this kind of evidence from around the world and Australia is a fascinating part of the global story.\u00a0\u00a0\nParticipants are introduced to the science of reconstructing past environments through a hands-on research project designed around an environmental research question. Students explore the classic methods and techniques used to understand deep time environmental change through the collection of sedimentary sequences and the laboratory analysis of a number of palaeoenvironmental indicators, such as pollen and charcoal. These two proxy data types reveal what was growing in the landscape at different times in the past and how often it burnt.\n\u00a0\nThe course provides students with an understanding of the intersection between palaeoecology, fire ecology, archaeology, palaeoclimatology and conservation management research. The program also explores how Indigenous people have tended country and altered environmental processes over the millennia, ultimately creating cultural landscapes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStudents will also meet and learn from some of ANU\u2019s leading researchers in this field as well as gain insight into ongoing research in the region, as we delve into how palaeoenvironmental science can play a role in understanding current and future environmental and societal challenges.\u00a0",

International environmental policy now directly and indirectly affects the behaviour and decisions of governments, corporations, NGOs, local communities and individuals.\n\u00a0\nThe course takes an interdisciplinary approach, drawing insights from areas including ecology, law, economics, international relations and politics, and incorporates lectures, guest speakers from NGOs and government, panel discussions, debates and workshops, with an emphasis on understanding the real-world dynamics of policy formation and debate. The course will cover the nature of IEP; its development over recent decades; the actors and institutions which form and influence it; and the conflicts which shape it. Key areas of debate within IEP will be examined, including tensions between conservation and development; conflicts around knowledge, science, and uncertainty; and reliance on 'command and control' vs market-based approaches. Cross-cutting issues include gender, the fight against poverty, the role of corporations and international initiatives such as the Sustainable Development Goals. These issues will be explored through analysis of topical case studies, such as equity and climate change; biodiversity and livelihoods; biofuels and deforestation; and genetically modified organisms and international trade.",

They deliver a suite of ecosystem services, at scales ranging from local to global. Forested landscapes may include some or all of native, plantation, farm and urban forest systems, as well as non-forest land uses. They range from ecologically intact to highly simplified systems; some are managed solely for their intrinsic (non-monetary) values, while others managed primarily for commercial production. Management approaches, constraints and opportunities are correspondingly diverse, although all should be underpinned by the principles of system resilience.\n\nThis course considers conceptual frameworks for managing forested landscapes with case studies of native, plantation, farm and urban forestry. Classroom learning is informed by numerous guest speakers, local field trips and discussion fora. We explore the translation of theory, policies and principles into practice by undertaking a major project analysing forest system resilience, policy options and practices of a particular form of forested landscape. We then share our learning with others in the course.\u00a0The course complements other Fenner School courses on policy and management of natural resources.",

The growth of Asian economies has been spectacular in the past 60 years; the advancement of Japan from the 1950s until the beginning of 1990s, the emerging Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan) in the 1980s, and the rapid transformation and growth of China and India since the 1990s. Asian capital markets are quite diverse as they consist of emerging markets at different stages of development as well as mature markets. Therefore, it is not easy to view Asian capital markets through a single lens. However, this course not only introduces students to capital markets in various Asian countries but also attempts at introducing a unified conceptual framework to understand markets in these countries. The framework focuses on institutional environments (such as legal systems) in different countries and their impacts on corporate behaviour. We also present empirical evidence that such a framework might not necessarily explain the recent developments in China and India. Two of the important features in Asian capital markets, which contrast those of capital markets in UK-US, are the roles played by the State and closely tied families, which we will discuss in detail. The globalization of the world economy in the past two decades has affected the developments of Asian capital markets. Although our course may discuss the development of capital markets of individual countries, we will discuss Asian economies in the global context and will explore the increasing weight of Asia in the world economy.",

Taking the city as analytical object, the course will be composed of seminars, visits to cultural sites including museums, monuments and ch\u00e2teaux, collaborative workshops and guided walking tours of historically and culturally-significant districts. The course will critique the dominant narratives and myths surrounding the city, studying Paris's reputation as a global capital of art, literature and politics. Yet it will do so while also exploring under-examined and forgotten parts of the city relating to colonial history, revolutionary history, the legacy of slavery and the evolution of the Republic. The analyses undertaken in this course will equip students with the knowledge and language to understand core concepts surrounding French history, culture and identity, studied through the prism of Parisian cultural heritage. Ultimately, the course will provide students not only with an understanding of Paris's past, but a deeper insight into France's complex present and the tools to understand France and French influence in the world into the future.\nStudents will only be permitted to travel upon completion of ANU required documentation, including, where required, the travel to a high risk destination form and the approval of all documentation by the relevant delegate.\nDisclaimer: Applicants are advised that due to circumstances beyond the University's control (for example, specific international security concerns and international health crises) it may not be possible for students to commence or complete this course as advertised, in which case an alternative lesson plan will be arranged to fulfil the course requirements.",

Coupling semiotics with theories of identity, subjectivity, ideology and discourse students will analyse power relationships in popular culture. Students will also become familiar with debates relating to production and consumption.

The course investigates how gender and culture inform the soft power strategies of national governments, the political and social norms underpinning health and medicine, and the ways Asian and Pacific societies face and respond to environmental crisis. A distinctive feature of this course is that students are asked to apply their conceptual understandings of gender and cultural studies in innovative ways through multimedia projects (no prior experience needed).

It traces the development of discourses around sex, sexuality and feminism in order to establish a \u201csex critical\u201d way of analysing cultural phenomena, especially\u00a0 complex issues of gender and identity. What are the effects of sexual imagery in mainstream culture? Is sex empowering or disempowering? What do feminist and queer writers think about the current condition? This course explores the \u201csexualisation\u201d of contemporary life starting with the second wave feminist and gay liberation movements of the 1970s onwards. It considers the impact of these early movements on subsequent feminist and queer perspectives and follows their continuing legacies and debates. Some of the topics the course covers include post-feminism, the pornography debates, the rise of raunch culture, issues surrounding consent and sex work, the impact of HIV/AIDS, the emergence of queer and trans identity politics, and the multi-dimensional linkages between race, sex, gender, sexuality and pleasure.",

Topics explored include: the saliency of the categories man and woman; the relationships between race and gender; the role of colonialism and neocolonialism in the representation of gender, sex and sexuality; the usefulness of the notion of oppression; the relationship between cultural conceptions of personhood and cultural conceptions of gender; and the ethnocentricity of the concepts of gender, sex and sexuality themselves. To assist these explorations we will make use of cross-cultural case studies in a number of areas including rape, prostitution, work and domesticity, the third sex and homosexuality.",

The course takes a historical and anthropological approach to examine the transformations of patterns of gender and sexuality in the Pacific through the successive encounters of exploratory voyages, Christian missions, labour trade and plantation development, World War II and militarism, mobility and the diaspora. Key thematic areas will include contemporary debates about women's influence and participation in church and state; gendered economies, kinship and land; transnational and regional feminisms and human rights; gender violence; gender, sexuality, health and HIV; and gender and sexual identities. The course will integrate readings and performances of literature, drama, and visual media by both Oceanic and foreign authors and artists. Indigenous Pacific Islander approaches to engaging and learning about Oceania are highlighted. The course draws upon the extensive academic expertise at ANU in gender and Pacific studies and is especially suitable for students of anthropology, history, politics, gender, sexuality and culture, Pacific studies, and development studies in both CAP and CASS.

Throughout Europe, Asia, the Americas, Africa, and the Pacific, the past 800 years have seen radical historical transformations as empires rose, sought to create and sustain the conditions of their dominance, and fell. Understanding these dynamics has also been among the most innovative areas of historical inquiry. This course explores these processes and how historians have interpreted their significance and legacies, from the Mongol conquests and the late Crusades to the present. It places the complex and always contested \u2018rise of the West\u2019 in a global frame by investigating a range of topics from Eurasian dynasties and the Spanish conquest of the Americas and the colonisation of India, Australia and New Zealand, to the Cold War. In doing so, it explores the technologies that enabled imperial growth, the ideologies that legitimated it, the resistance of many who fought against it, and associated movements of populations and international relations. Through a diversity of historical perspectives, it examines the impact of imperial exchanges in transforming institutions, environments and modes of life.\u00a0",

What factors have led to changing experiences of health and illness in history, and why have some groups fared better or worse than others?\n\nMore than the history of bodies and medicine, this course provides cultural, economic, environmental, legal, political and social perspectives on various forms of sickness \u2013 from smallpox, plague and cholera to venereal disease, alcoholism and AIDS. Students will also learn how health policies and practices have produced distinct outcomes in different regions and periods.\n\nScience and medicine have conquered many diseases over recent centuries. But trade, exploration, colonisation, mass migration, environmental exploitation, industrialisation, war, urbanisation, political ideologies and international relations have exerted greater influence, and these factors continue to shape patterns of sickness and wellness.\n\nPower and authority sit at the heart of the relationship between illness and wellbeing. This course considers that theme by asking: how have different forms of illness and evolving health measures exposed, created and levelled inequalities? Additional questions include: What strategies have been authorized to combat illness in the pursuit of public health? Under what circumstances did health come to be considered a right?",

Drawing from historian Fred Inglis' argument that celebrity is a \u2018product of culture and technology\u2019, an \u2018adhesive\u2019 that pulls together \u2018public politics, civil society, and private domestic life\u2019, this journey through the history of celebrity will track the rise of individualism, consumerism, the arrival of mass media and the emerging impact of digital formats and social media.

Over this period the problem of crime and efforts to devise effective means of delivering justice posed an ongoing challenge for legislators, philosophers, religious leaders, scientific experts, and institutional managers.What counts as crime? How should crime be controlled? Does mercy have a place in punishment? Is the state an agent of injustice? Debate over these questions led to new institutions, practices, and concepts, including: the invention of the penitentiary; the abolition of capital punishment; and the rise of eugenics.Lectures and readings will focus on key dilemmas that brought crime and justice into question. Tutorials will involve the analysis of original documents and the essay will explore an historical crime and justice dilemma in depth. \u00a0\u00a0",

This course traces the cultural, political, religious and philosophical forces that inspired revolutionary thinkers to question old world inequalities and injustice. However, the earliest efforts to establish human rights applied only to privileged minorities and dominant nations.\nHow did the concept of universal human rights arise? What role has individual and collective voices of protest played in this development? What sorts of actions have been taken to protest rights violations? On what basis has the denial of rights to particular groups been justified?\u00a0\nThe answers to these questions have differed internationally and over time. This course will focus on slavery and forced labour; colonisation; gender disparities and sexual minorities; environmental disasters and degradation; religious oppression; genocide; asylum seeking; the right to die; prisoners\u2019 rights; and political persecution. \u00a0\u00a0",

Australians overcame 'cultural cringe', took to Australian films, literature and music, reached out to Asia and embraced multiculturalism. They also took to the streets to protest against the Vietnam War, uranium mining and the nuclear threat, and Aboriginal oppression, while demanding legal abortions and gay rights. It was a time of ferment, and radical social and legal reform. Charismatic political leaders galvanised public attention and raised the level of debate. Censorship was challenged, rock music was everywhere, and sex seemed to be too. This course will take a wide view of Australian politics, involvement in and withdrawal from the Vietnam War, and social change. It will consider why these were such decades of change and what we can learn about processes of change and reform, using texts, photographs, music and films from the period.\u00a0",

This course examines the troubled history of attempts to re-establish prosperity and democracy in the postwar period. In Eastern Europe, Communist dictatorships claimed to provide a superior political and economic system. In Western Europe, the strengthening of democracy often took a back seat to the demands of the Cold War, the legacies of totalitarianism, the reluctance to decolonise and the prioritisation of economic growth. Protest and dissent - from students, feminists and terrorists \u2013 marked both East and West.

Against all expectations, the Bolsheviks maintained power and continued to hold it through civil war, rapid industrialization, colossal loss of life to famine and terror, Nazi invasion and the Cold War before the Soviet Empire collapsed in a remarkably bloodless dissolution in 1991. This course traces the rise and fall of the Russian Revolution, from the disintegration of the Tsarist Empire through the revolutionary era and Stalinism to the height of Soviet power after the Second World War and its dissolution in the late twentieth century. What was Communism and how did it triumph in Russia? What was life like before, under and after Stalin, and why did a regime that withstood civil war, invasion and cold war consign itself so meekly to the dustbin of history?",

From the ninth to the thirteenth centuries, Europe experienced significant migration of peoples and witnessed the emergence of enduring political, legal, and social institutions.\u00a0At the same time, divisions between and consolidation of religious institutions took place alongside the flourishing of dynamic intellectual and cultural centres, while expanding horizons to the north, south and east of Europe led to both productive and violent exchanges with peoples and places beyond the continental mainland.\nAdopting a Global Middle Ages approach, this course will examine medieval Europe between c. 850 and 1300 from the twin perspectives of cultures and conflicts. To consider the important role these interlinked facets of medieval life played in shaping the European world, this course will explore a range of topics, including Viking raids and Norse settlement in Europe; the spread of Christianity; Angevins and empire; crusades;  Mediterranean cultures, including those in Sicily and Al-Andalus; heresies and religious persecution; and Mongol invasions. By assessing cultures and conflicts across Europe in the centuries after the reign of Charlemagne, this course will introduce students to political structures, social systems, and cultural phenomena that shaped medieval Europe and would have a lasting impact on the centuries to come.",

Understanding the diversity of African cultures requires that we decolonize history, and reconsider Eurocentric assumptions about the nature of society, politics, and the identity inherited from European models and the Atlantic slave trade. Due to the complexity and size of the African continent, as well as the diversity of its diaspora, the course is not intended to cover the whole of African history. We will examine race, gender, and religion as central issues in precolonial, colonial, and postcolonial contexts for both the continent and its diasporic peripheries. The course aims to study the connections between African cultures and their refraction in Haiti, Jamaica, Cuba, Brazil and the United States. We will also examine historical events, including the impact of missionaries, the transatlantic slave trade and large-scale slavery, that led to the creation of a forced diaspora and the breakdown of traditional African thought on the continent and its refraction in the diaspora.",

Subsequently we will consider a number of substantive topics of bioethical concern, and do so from a range of disciplinary perspectives, thereby attempting to 'go beyond' the limits of applied bioethical thought. Concepts and definitions of life and death will be discussed in the context of contemporary bioethical discourse. We will then explore the phenomenon of medicalisation in which human conditions and problems come to be defined and treated as medical conditions. This will then be taken up in the context of bioethical speculations regarding \u2018love drugs.\u2019 Looking to the future, we will explore emerging bioethical challenges brought by rapid advances in technology and medicine as well as interrelated social changes and cultural developments. Having taken this course you will have a good grasp of bioethics as an academic field, as an influential mode of thought that not only shapes the way we understand the life sciences and healthcare but also contributes to the way we shape ourselves and our moral culture(s).

Students will have the opportunity to engage directly with cultural collections and institutions and develop projects designed to address the ongoing digitisation of our shared cultural record. Students will be supported to propose and build digital projects that could be used by cultural institutions large or small. These might include research tools, public outreach and engagement, educational, or, games and creative responses to cultural data sets. Projects can engage with museums, galleries, archives or libraries. Projects are developed over the entire semester from pitch to project plan, prototype for user testing and a final digital project accompanied by an exegesis. These projects are expected to be situated in the broader field and to engage with critical, ethical, theoretical issues. Students are given the opportunity to liaise directly with curators and other experts from institutions to pitch ideas and to develop skills in collaboration and project planning. No technical skills are required and students are supported to upskill from their own level of experience. Support is offered to work with a range of software and digital methods, and final projects can be published online using digital platforms. Students from a range of backgrounds are welcome and the course is designed to support students from computer science as well students studying in the humanities and social sciences.",

The course will introduce students to key issues and debates in the field, from debates over AI to digitisation in GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, museums) and the use and misuse of big data. Students will be supported to learn a range of digital-led methodologies (for example - photogrammetry, linked data, crowdsourcing, web surveys, data analysis) that will support their own digital humanities projects.

            "description": "Digital technologies have infiltrated nearly all aspects of our existence, covering each natural and cultural urge from ordering food, checking our banking details, finding a partner, or paying our taxes. Our interactions with new digital and computational technologies affect how we think of ourselves and our cultural heritage, both individually and collectively; they influence the ways in which we interact socially and politically; and, they affect how we determine public and private spaces in an increasingly connected world. Our digital legacies even outlast our lives, preserving some part of us even once we are gone. Regardless of the level of involvement, we are all living in the digital era.\u00a0This course engages the students to discuss some of the key ways in which the digital has affected our lives, and what it really means. We examine different manifestations of human culture as it occurs online, pulling in examples from social media, the cultural heritage sector, even the Dark Web. We examine the ethical implications for collecting data about people, critique the ways in which information is presented and retrieved online, discuss popular trends and online behaviours, and tackle questions related to some of the less pleasant aspects of online culture. In order to do so, we need a thoughtful, ethical, critical, and interdisciplinary approach to the study and development of technology. Technology should be understood together with, and in the context of, understanding humanity. Understanding the technology alone is not enough, we need to understand how technology and humanity interact.\n\nExamples of topics and methods covered: Crowdsourcing, Social media analysis (social networking, sentiment analysis, etc), AI and ML methods and problems, Gaming and gamification, Linked Data and Knowledge Representation, Tech utopias/dystopias, Privacy and trust online, Ethics, research, data etc",

Technology is also transforming the way that we access and engage with cultural institutions and arts organisations. However, Digital Humanities is more than just using computers for research, it is a highly critical and scholarly field that consciously considers how humanities topics of research and research practices themselves are being transformed in the digital age. This course introduces students to key methodologies and critical theories in digital humanities. Students have the opportunity to learn, trial and evaluate a range of digital methodologies (ranging from digital mapping, data cleaning, 3D modelling, digitisation, metadata and database creation, digital publishing and audience engagement). Students study the ways that digital and computational methods are transforming research in humanities. There is a particular focus on how digital technologies and projects can be used to engage broader society with humanities and cultural sector research (including design for digital audiences, public history and public culture). The course also addresses complex ethical issues around ownership of data, digital repatriation, politics of archives, and the potential for digital activism. The course includes visits to major cultural institutions in Canberra and talks from experts in digital humanities research from across the ANU.\n\nNo specific technical or computational knowledge is assumed, all students will be supported to work with a range of digital methodologies and practices from whatever level they are at. Students will be given access to the Digital Humanities Lab and its specialist equipment and software. Students will be asked to critically evaluate tools and methods, as well as engaging with key readings, issues and debates, and critical theories. Projects and essays developed for this course may form part of Masters Advanced and Honours thesis projects subject to approval from your supervisor and program convener.",

It is a practical, introductory research course that introduces students to the principles of Indigenous research: practices, collaboration and ethics.\u00a0\u00a0This course is suitable for students who are considering working in Indigenous policy, organisations and research contexts.\u00a0\n\nThis course provides practical lessons about what constitutes good research practice and how to engage ethically in Indigenous spaces. It facilitates more respectful and meaningful engagement with (and between) Indigenous peoples, knowledges and ways of knowing and greater insight into the relevance of Indigenous perspectives in every sphere of knowledge and practice.\u00a0\n\nStudents are introduced to Indigenous perspectives about ways of doing Indigenous research. This includes developing knowledge about relationship building and how to undertake Indigenous research in a safe and ethical manner in accordance with Indigenous protocols. Students learn about the history of and developments in Indigenous research and how Indigenous knowledges and methodologies have challenged and changed Indigenous research practices within and outside academia. Students will be introduced to aspects of research design and practice, including quantitative, qualitative, and mixed method approaches for engaging in Indigenous research, including\u00a0what is\u00a0the difference, and what are the similarities, between indigenous and general research methods (including traditional and de-colonised methods).\u00a0Students will also learn about the nuances and distinctions in \u2018insider\u2019 and \u2018outsider\u2019 and even \u2018outsider/insider\u2019 researcher identities and understanding how and in what context each of the researcher\u2019s identity is appropriate.

Students are introduced to the global wars which shape history on grand scales and to the local conflicts that persist in the background. We want to know: Why do we fight? What is conflict? Is conflict sometimes good? Who are insurgents? What is terrorism? How do we maintain memories of conflict? Is future conflict inevitable? We explore big questions through political science, strategic studies, international relations, anthropology, history, law, gender studies and psychology lenses. These specific disciplinary orientations, infused by insights from Asian and European traditions of thought, offer their own answers in the study of peace and conflict. Our approach in this course is integrative, interrogative and critical. We analyse the causes of war and conflict; the nature of security and strategic decision-making; the political drivers of international and sub-national conflicts; the use of technologies and tactics; and the public presentation of war and conflict. The regional orientation of this course\u2014reflecting the Australian National University's strengths\u2014is the Asia-Pacific region. The questions that we examine find some of their answers in East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Pacific. To provide students with a robust foundation for further study, this course draws on the range of expertise that makes ANU the hub for the critical analysis of the big questions concerning war and conflict. It is appropriate for those who wish to develop knowledge of specific situations of peace and conflict, as well as for students who hope for a broad overview of the topic.",

Pessimists even see the menacing potential for new wars looming just over the horizon. What are the conditions for sustainable peace? This course begins by examining the mechanisms available for bringing about peaceful resolutions to conflict and war. We seek to analyse the prospects for peace in the 21st century through a close engagement with examples of conflict resolution and peacebuilding from across the Asia-Pacific region. These case-studies each illustrate different challenges and approaches to conflict resolution and peace building. Students will be encouraged to consider the communication strategies, attitudes towards justice, political instincts and other practical attributes that are relevant to resolving conflict and building peace in such contexts. To facilitate a hands-on appreciation of those attributes, the course includes a hypothetical exercise designed to challenge us to look at peace efforts from a variety of real-world perspectives.The ANU uses Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity.

The course is designed to examine the origins, contemporary relevance, nature and future of human rights promotion and protection in Southeast Asia from a regional and institutional perspective by juxtaposing the growing commitment to rights within ASEAN, the shifting fortunes of domestic and regional civil society, and the participation of regional states in extra-regional rights activities, most notably at the United Nations. In doing so it seeks to explain Southeast Asia's unique approach to institutionalising human rights, and to provide students the opportunity to critically assess the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. The course provides an opportunity to assess the multi-institutional nature of the Southeast Asian human rights space through considering the role of domestic, regional, transnational and global actors.",

The traditional definition of security premised on military defence of a territory puts human security and social factors at the periphery. Advocates for a human security approach argue that to insist on a narrower state-centric security paradigm at the expense of human security would leave the concept of security bereft of any practical meaning in many real-world circumstances. What is human security, and what kinds of security issues, problems or conflicts can it be applied to? How do human security perspectives generate different approaches and policies to traditional security thinking? In what ways does a human security approach provide innovative perspectives to address sources of insecurity more holistically? This course will critically examine the human security concept and a range of key human security issues in the Asian region, including intra-state and ethnic conflict, post-conflict peace building, displaced persons and refugees, landmines and small arms, the protection of children in conflict, and poverty and human development.",

During face-to-face workshops and tutorials students work in small groups reading, discussing and writing about a broad range of real-world materials. The focus of this section of the course is to help students to transition from the certainty of a textbook to the ambiguity and confusion of real-world Japanese.\u00a0 The language of instruction for this class is Japanese and it is expected that all students will make every effort to use only Japanese in class time and class-related correspondence.",

This is because the content in the relevant companion course is utilised in various ways in Foundations of Australian Law.\nFoundations of Australian Law is designed to lay the groundwork for the remainder of students' legal studies. In particular, the course aims to assist students to develop a range of legal skills that are crucial for successful legal studies and for professional practice. Students learn the essential skills that enable them to engage with and use our principal sources of law - case law and legislation. In addition to teaching students how to analyse case law and legislation and to formulate legal arguments, the course also covers the key legal principles of statutory interpretation and the role of the courts in interpreting statutes.\nTo set the context for these sources of Australian law, the course also seeks to familiarise students with \nsome of the fundamental features of the legal institutions that generate laws (the courts and the Parliament); sources of Australian law in addition to case law and legislation (including the Australian Constitution, customary law and international law); and the historical and social forces that have shaped and continue to shape the law-making process and the legal system.",

'Law' comprises the rules and norms that any society creates to govern how its members should interact with one another. Societal factors provide context to the legal system, and vice versa. To properly examine any country's laws and legal system one needs to have at least some degree of understanding of the dynamics and values of that society. The purpose of this course is to provide a foundation for understanding the history, place and use of law in modern Japan. The course covers the history, structure, and fundamental substantive areas of Japanese law. It investigates and challenges some of the assumptions about the place of law in Japanese society, including legal history, judicial system, legal education, and the legal profession. There is some treatment of other aspects of Japan's legal society including litigation, foreigners, women, and minorities. The course then focuses on Japanese substantive law include the foundations and current topics in Japanese constitutional, criminal, contract, tort, and commercial law. The overarching theme of the course is the globalisation of Japanese law in a wide range of subject areas, including civil and criminal justice, gender and the law, public law and some aspects of business regulation. The particular focus of the course is on Japanese corporate and commercial law, analysing how that law both reflects and has transformed Japanese capitalist society in the 21st century.\n\nStudents must apply to undertake this course.

In the federal system of Australia, this can occur both within a domestic intra-Australia context and in an international context. While this course deals with a number of specific theoretical frameworks, it is taught largely from a practical standpoint aimed at preparing lawyers for handling cases with trans-jurisdictional issues. The three core components of the course investigate:\nJurisdiction: When domestic courts can hear cases that involve parties and property from outside the territory of the court.Choice of Law: Which law is applicable when a case has connections with a number of different jurisdictions. In particular, this course considers contract, family and tort disputes that involve a variety of jurisdictions.Enforcement of Judgements: How to enforce a court judgement or arbitral award from another jurisdiction in local courts.",

We will look at constitutional law in further detail, focusing on how Australia and other democracies use constitutional law \u2013 both written and unwritten \u2013 to regulate the democratic process (elections, referendums, parliaments, political parties, etc).\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe especially consider attempts to use law to improve the practice of democratic politics \u2013 for example, to make politics less partisan, more fair and equal, more rational, or more democratic. We also consider whether such legal solutions have met with success or have tended to raise new problems of their own. Looking at international comparisons will help to answer questions about whether alternative constitutional systems for regulating democracy have been effective overseas, and whether or not they could be adopted in Australia.\n\u00a0\nThis is a semi-intensive course running for only half of the semester. The seminar format will be a mixture of discussion and lecture-style presentation, with breaks. Discussions will centre in part around informal student \u2018Responses\u2019 to readings (see below). Seminars will be punctuated by hands-on 'demonstrations' giving concrete illustrations of the themes we will discuss. There will usually be at least one demonstration per class. For example, you will try your hand at \u2018gerrymandering\u2019 to rort a hypothetical electoral system. We will also have compelling visiting speakers such as leading lawyers and top government officials.\u00a0\n\u00a0",

Whilst it places particular emphasis on the applicable Commonwealth, NSW and ACT law, the course reviews fundamental concepts, useful tools and insights with which to understand and critically analyse environmental law.\n\u00a0Topics covered include:\nintroduction defining the 'environment', 'ecologically sustainable development';the common law and environmental protection;environmental law in a federal system;role of local and state governments;statutory land-use planning and development control law;evironmental impact assessment law;bodiversity law;native vegetation law;pollution control law;a brief introduction to climate change and energy law;environmental litigation;enforcement of environmental law; andmajor projects law.",

'Law' comprises the rules and norms that any society creates to govern how its members should interact with one another. Societal factors provide context to the legal system, and vice versa. To properly examine any country's laws and legal system one needs to have at least some degree of understanding of the dynamics and values of that society. The purpose of this course is to provide a foundation for understanding the history, place and use of law in modern Japan. The course covers the history, structure, and fundamental substantive areas of Japanese law. It investigates and challenges some common assumptions about the place of law in Japanese society, including Japan's legal history, judicial system, legal education, and legal profession. The course explores topics including the place of litigation in Japan, and the treatment of non-Japanese, women, and minorities. The course then focuses on Japanese substantive law include the foundations of and current topics in Japanese constitutional, criminal, contract, tort, and commercial law. The overarching theme of the course is the globalisation of Japanese law in a wide range of subject areas, including civil and criminal justice, gender and the law, public law and some aspects of business regulation.",

Studying works of visual art allows us to get under the skin of our legal values and legal ideologies. And while artists have turned the spirit of justice and the power of the law into visual form, they have also been prominent critics of it. Injustice and suffering are given a vivid presence and an emotional weight through the visual arts, in ways that has often led the law to be fearful of its capacity to disturb and challenge us.\nThis course introduces students to a flourishing new area of interdisciplinary study. It offers an overview of key texts introducing theories and methods in law and visual studies. The course then explores a diverse range of topical case studies that examine law through art and art through law; including Justice, Power, Ideology, Colonialism, Environment, and War. Students undertake a journey from the Ghazi Stadium in Kabul, to the Supreme Court of Mexico, from nineteenth century Van Diemen\u2019s Land to contemporary Australian masterworks. In the process we will learn to see both law and art through different eyes, transforming forever what and how they mean. It is offered at both 2000 level and 4000 level and is suitable both for students taking courses in the School of Art as part of their Arts degree, and in the College of Law as part of their Law degree.",

It presents constitutional, human rights and property law relating to Indigenous peoples in their socio-political, historical and cultural contexts, questioning the adequacy of the current state of the law with a view to possibilities for future law reform. It acknowledges the disproportionately large role of the law in the lives of this arguably overly-regulated but under-protected group of peoples, providing an understanding of some of the central legal issues facing Indigenous Australians, and the impact this has and has had on Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. The course covers issues relating to legal definitions of Indigeneity, the relationship between Indigenous Australians and the state, self-determination, racial discrimination, rights to lands and waters, and the place of Indigenous Australians in the world community of Indigenous peoples. As such, it builds on concepts introduced in Australian Public Law, International Law and Property Law.",

We will explore the \u2018Foundations of Law\u2019 through the humanistic disciplines of classics, literature, philosophy and theology, which present different modes and means of inquiring into the assumptions and aspirations that we ascribe to law.",

            "description": "This course introduces students to the law of personal bankruptcy in Australia and further develops the law of corporate insolvency - as broadly introduced in the prerequisite course, Corporations Law. While understanding legal terminology, concepts, doctrine and processes are all vital to grasping and applying bankruptcy and insolvency laws, the course also seeks to frame those aspects in a wider historical, social, economic and policy context.\nThe course begins with an overview of debtor-creditor relations and the pre-insolvency context. Beyond this introductory phase, the course is broadly divided into two blocks, focusing initially upon personal bankruptcy - with attention directed to the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) - and then corporate insolvency - focusing upon Part 5 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).\nThe course will be of interest to a variety of students. The Global Financial Crisis has generated tremendous activity and many opportunities in this field of law, as well as public pressure for reforming the law. Bankruptcy\u00a0and Insolvency is a key area of specialised or general legal practice in firms of all sizes and locations. Many issues within this field overlap with a range of other fields such as: contracts, torts, property, equity and trusts, succession, constitutional, criminal, litigation and dispute management, evidence, commercial law, corporate law, banking\u00a0and finance, taxation, administrative law, consumer protection, employment and family law. The course may also be of particular interest to students undertaking combined degrees or having experience or employment aspirations in business, commerce, public policy or the community law sector - and, indeed, to anyone else with an over-extended credit card.",

The government continues to at least express a belief in the benefits of the free access to information as a means of enhancing the effectiveness and legitimacy of government. Whistleblowing is recognised as a valid mechanism of government accountability but only in limited circumstances. Disclosure as a means building, and destroying, reputations is increasingly being used as a regulatory tool. This course seeks to bring these issues together in examining the legal issues arising from the access, collection, use, storage and disclosure of information in its various forms.\nThis course will look at the various ways in which the legal system either seeks to maintain the secrecy of information, or encourages its dissemination. It will look at the different ways in which information is treated when held by government as opposed to private entities. It will also use information as a vehicle to examine the law reform process through the responses to the changing way in which information is being generated and viewed in our society. \u00a0",

This will then allow more detailed exploration of a series of institutional issues (such as the legislative arrangements for important national security institutions, and the \u2018security law\u2019 making and monitoring process), practical issues (such as use of force, and use of classified information in prosecutions), and thematic issues (such as the national security \u2013 civil rights balancing debate).",

It introduces students to major research now undertaken that reflects the view that law is neither divorced from nor above the cultural forces and representations all around us. Whether as a lawyer, an activist, a politician, a writer, a diplomat, or a citizen, we face a global world whose enormous challenges will require of us the ability to understand the relationship between legal discourse and other discourses such as art, human rights and literature which responses to these challenges. Human rights offers a legal and moral framework that attempts to address experiences of injustice, suffering, and traumatic loss. To address these effectively we need to draw on a range of vocabularies and discourses, and be able to mediate between them\u2014to compare, contrast and evaluate their meanings and impacts. \u00a0In Literature Law and Human Rights, we study the representation, advocacy and critique of human rights in different genres, including their treatment in law and literature, including film and the visual arts. \u00a0Each of these forms of storytelling are devised to solicit strong reactions in an audience. Whether in Palestine, Africa, or Alice Springs, law, literature and human rights are different languages for expressing injustice and for demanding redress. \u00a0Each are powerful in their own way. A lawyer, an activist, a novelist, and a film-maker are all storytellers with specific means at their disposal, and specific goals in mind. But just what kinds of storytelling are they? How do they differ from one another, and how do they influence one another? \u00a0In what ways does literature (in the broadest sense) help organize our understanding of human rights, and mobilize legal responses? And on the other hand, in what ways does law constitute a literature of human rights, and with what consequences?\n\t\u00a0",

From a legal point of view, the Constitution may refer to a specific document or set of documents. \u00a0But legal theorists and philosophers recognize that this institutional form is only the tip of the iceberg. \u00a0Law, as an expression of collective belonging, is constituted through images and metaphors that bring its concepts to life. As the famous frontispiece to Thomas Hobbes' classic work Leviathan depicts, \u2018the body politic' is not a ready-made entity, but a complex composition from disparate elements. The problem of how legal order is generated and maintained brings it into close relationship with social, political and aesthetic forms. The shape of our collective relationship to a legal and social order is constantly being made, remade, and unmade.\u00a0This course draws on the resources of critical theory, philosophy, aesthetics, and legal scholarship, to interrogate urgent contemporary problems pertaining to the establishment and maintenance of legal order and public identity, examining the terms on which we speak of sovereignty, democracy, rights, citizenship, and State violence. \u00a0Our interdisciplinary analysis relates these terms to the wider representational frames they inhabit; explores contemporary sites of constitution and deconstitution, including through art, media, and protest; and introduces students to relevant methods and theories.",

            "description": "The Prison Legal Literacy Clinic offers students a unique opportunity to work with detainees in a prison setting at the Alexander Maconochie Centre (AMC). The AMC is the Australian Capital Territory's only adult prison, accommodating all persons who have been sentenced to full-time imprisonment or remanded in custody by ACT Courts.\nThe Prison Legal Literacy Clinic was developed from the highly successful ANU College of Law, Law Reform and Social Justice Prison Legal Literacy Program which commenced in 2010.\u00a0\nStudents in the Prison Legal Literacy Clinic will attend the AMC to deliver six legal literacy sessions for a cohort of detainees chosen by AMC management. These sessions provide legal information only, rather than legal advice. The first session focuses on establishing mutually agreed rules and boundaries, developing respectful relationships and identifying areas of legal interest to detainees that will become the topics for the remaining five sessions. These topics are as diverse as detainees interests but may involve laws and legal process relating to criminal law, evidence, sentencing, appeals, parole, administrative law, human rights law and tort law. Many topics require students to convey an understanding of the democratic process of law making, the federal system of law as well as the hierarchy and jurisdiction of courts and tribunals.\u00a0The emphasis is on students working as a team to develop informative, engaging and interactive sessions. Student are required to undertake significant research in each week of the session delivery phase of the course, often in areas of law that are unfamiliar to them. Detainees who complete the program are presented with a certificate in the final session acknowledge their efforts.\nStudents will be provided with Security Awareness Training by the AMC and supported before and during the delivery stage of the program by the course convenor who will be present at, and guide the delivery of, each of the Legal Literacy Sessions at the AMC.\nFollowing the delivery of six sessions (in the first 6 weeks of the semester) students are required to submit a reflective assessment. Students will then use the remaining six weeks of the semester to write a research paper on a legal topic they have identified from their experience with detainees within the AMC. Students will be supported to develop and hone their research papers in workshops that will be held in the second half of the semester.\n\nStudents must apply to undertake this course.

Central to the course is the examination of the adequacy of the current state of Australian legal education, legal practice, law and justice in relation to First Nations peoples, with a view to possibilities for reform.\nThe course acknowledges the multidimensional roles of law and explores connections between law, culture and identity and between law, legitimacy and resources. Additional issues include the roles of legal education, legal practice and the legal system concerning how lawfulness and justice are constructed and performed. The course incorporates consideration of substantive areas of law such as legal ethics, property, criminal and civil law.\nThe course presents principles and tools to support reappraisal and future leadership to better address legal and societal dimensions of justice, rights and empowerment for First Nations peoples.\nThe course covers issues relating to Indigenous world views, historical and contemporary Indigenous experiences of settler-colonialism, the phenomena of legacy relationships and legacy systems, and concepts of cultural safety and decolonisation. Students will critically assess the implications of issues for themselves, relating to Indigenous peoples, and relating to the future of law and justice in Australia. As such, the course builds on concepts introduced in Lawyers, Justice and Ethics, Australian Public Law, International Law and Property Law.\nStudents will complete orientation workshops (max 6 hours) prior to departure, complete the on country intensive (5 days), and submit reflective assessments. Students will have six weeks after completing the intensive to write a research paper on an aspect of decolonising legal education, legal practice, law and justice in Australia and present their findings.\n\nStudents must apply to undertake this course.

            "description": "The rule of law is a specific historical development of global significance, and one that is inextricable from colonial histories and postcolonial conditions. Proponents\nthroughout the world, including Australia and the Asia-Pacific, point to it as a solution to an array of problems. Critics for their part lambast it as neocolonial and\nexploitative. In this course, we cover the ground between these poles by turning to the rule of law in its particulars, through study of its relationship to colonialism and postcolonialism in Asia, Australia and beyond. By bringing together extractive colonial and settler colonial cases we aim to identify similarities and differences in the experience\nof colonialism and the rule of law, and query both the idea of the rule of law as preeminent political ideal for our time as well as contrariwise positions that treat it as\nnothing other than a fig leaf for colonial domination and oppression. Importantly, we will also look at the continuing legacy of colonial legal and political histories, and the\nrelationship of the rule of law to political and social crises in our time.\n\nBy taking an historical and cultural approach to the rule of law, we will expand and deepen our understanding of these regions' pasts and present day conditions, as well as\nadopt an empirically informed perspective on how and why the rule of law is so pervasive. Students will gain new insights into legal history and colonial power in a wide\nvariety of places, including but not limited to Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Singapore, as well as through regional organisations. They will also consider in detail\nhow the interaction between colonialism and the rule of law in Australia is at once distinct from and similar to that of the country\u2019s regional neighbours.\nThis course is jointly taught in the College of Asia and the Pacific and the ANU College of Law. The Department of Political and Social Change is offering the course for\nstudents enrolled in the Bachelor of Asian Studies and Master of Asia Pacific Studies, and in the ANU Law School for students enrolled in LLB and JD programs. The\ncourse will also be open to students in the Bachelor of Arts, and we expect interest from students doing the sociology, politics, development studies and human rights\nmajors in particular. The course is deliberately interdisciplinary in its contents, modes of instruction and methods. It draws on a rich comparative socio-legal,\nanthropological, sociological and political scientific literature that in recent years has delivered an impressive range of studies on the rule of law in different colonial times\nand places, and work that ties the empirical contents of the course to overarching concepts of legality, authority and power.",

However, barriers to justice include extreme disadvantage, gross under-resourcing of non-profit legal services in the region and enormous lacks relating to law and justice across the cultural interface.\n\nIn this course student learning is driven by involvement in law in action justice work. The course is structured around students undertaking paralegal work at the KCLS Aboriginal Justice Clinic at the Law School. The clinic is incorporated real-time in the KCLS legal practice and students are supervised by KCLS lawyers. This is an immersive and challenging context for guided exploration about how law has been instrumentalized in relation to First Nations peoples, and the impacts. Also, whether and how laws, legal institutions and legal practice can become forces for empowerment.\u00a0\n\nThe course includes consideration of substantive areas of law, public policy, and critical Indigenous legal theories and presents principles and concepts which are pressed by First Nations peoples in pursuit of justice, rights and empowerment. The course emphasises the voices, lived experiences and authority of Aboriginal people of the Kimberley and engages and supports students in exploring how theory works in step with practice and reflection. \n\nAccordingly, students will complete a workshop program which incorporates familiarization with KCLS and the Hotdesk, key skills, self-care, cultural protocols, and the concepts of reflection, reflexivity, settler-colonialism, epistemic injustice and approaches to empowerment. Students also complete a minimum of 10 x 1 day (7 hour) paralegal sessions at the KCLS-ANU Hotdesk and assessments consisting of reflective case studies which critically explore readings and themes in the course, and a research paper related to themes in the course.",

Beginning with a study of the fundamental elements of ancient rhetoric as set out by Aristotle, Cicero and Quintilian, we will examine some of the most famous examples of persuasive speech from the ancient world, including the appeal to Achilles in Homer\u2019s Iliad, Socrates' Apology, and the speeches of Cicero. We will then apply our knowledge of rhetorical style to an analysis of famous examples of persuasive discourse and writing from the modern era, such as Martin Luther King Jr's \"Letter from Birmingham Jail\", John F. Kennedy's \"Inaugural Address\" and the speeches of Winston Churchill, Sir Robert Menzies and Paul Keating. The course will examine the role of persuasion in modern politics, law, advertising and marketing and there will be opportunities for students to practise their skills in persuasive writing and discourse. Students will have opportunities to analyse the rhetorical techniques deployed in legal judgments and guest lecturers will specifically address the art of persuasion in the legal context, particularly with respect to advocacy in court.",

This course provides a critical overview of the issues we face today and in the coming decades, with an emphasis on Australia's role in the global space sector, and our potential leadership in shaping international norms.\n\nOur current international space governance regime is a product of the Cold War and the dawn of the space age, however today\u2019s multi-polar geopolitical world no longer operates with those power relations. We are also entering an age of commerce-based space politics, disruptive technologies and disruptive business models, all of which puts pressures on domestic law-makers in the governance of space activities. Concerns such as environmental responsibility, equitable access to space-based technologies, the weaponisation, commercialisation and colonisation of space, will all be covered.

Generally speaking, private law is equated with \u2018economics\u2019 and public law with \u2018politics\u2019. These demarcations are neither intellectually rigorous nor practically useful. For that reason, the proposed course aims to bridge these gaps. It will offer our students an opportunity to bring together different strands of their studies, including public and private as well as domestic and international law. In so doing, the course will invite students to think about how law creates the concepts and institutions that sustain economic production and circulation in Australia and globally. Additionally, it will give students the tools to understand the changing ideas about the relationship between law and political economy that have underpinned common law legal systems for the past 150 years.",

You will gain practical training in how to articulate and perceive different speech sounds and transcribe them using the International Phonetic alphabet, and learn about relevant aspects of anatomy, physics and cognition. You will also be introduced to computer aided phonetic analysis using open source software, and methods of data collection for phonetic and phonological research. You will gain experience in applying principles of phonological analysis to describe and represent distinctions and distributional patterns in the sound systems of different languages, and undertake detailed research on a specific language. This course will provide you with skills in two core subdisciplines of linguistics and a foundation for studies in fields such as forensic linguistics, historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, linguistic typology, language acquisition, and speech pathology.",

In the first and larger part of the course, students will be introduced to the grammar of Standard Modern English, learning terminology and analytical techniques which linguists use to build on and modify traditional grammar. The structural characteristics of English will be compared with those of other languages where appropriate. The last part of the course will deal with variation in English, including regional, social and stylistic variation. Special attention will be paid to 'new Englishes' which have arisen as a result of the learning of English as a second language by people whose first language is not English.\nNote: While the course is not aimed at improving the English of non-native speakers, students with English as a second language should find that this course will improve their understanding of the workings of the language at a deep level and have practical effects in helping them to eliminate systematic errors in their English. \u00a0These students as well as native speakers of English will learn metalanguage which will be of assistance to them in understanding and acting on constructive criticisms made by teachers on the language of their essays and other writing.",

A general framework for understanding verbal as well as non-verbal communication across and between groups is outlined, drawing on insights from linguistics, psychology, anthropology, tourism, media and communication studies.",

In the modern state, language tests are powerful tools of policy. They can be used to reduce the risk of miscommunication in the workplace, or to measure educational achievement, but they can also be used to filter linguistic diversity or to exclude certain groups. Starting from the concept of \u2018a language\u2019, this course explores the complex relationships between language use, language acquisition, and mechanisms, such as policies, standardized tests and assessment processes. Throughout the course, there is an emphasis on both theory and practice. Students will examine a range of policy contexts and learn about the principles of language test design and validation, enabling them to make informed connections between government or institutional policies, their instruments and the sociopolitical priorities that drive them. The course is co-constructed: students will contribute to the course content by selecting and reporting on case studies of interest to them.

In this course we introduce students to this relatively new field of healthcare communication research, accumulatively building up their qualitative and mixed methods research skills to undertake their own research project in this area. The lectures will detail both national and international evidence based research. The course will develop skills to firstly critically analyse features of effective and ineffective communication practices and then to translate these insights to the development of communication frameworks, models and training to improve clinical practice. Students will develop skills for analysing naturally-occurring healthcare interactions, and they will have the opportunity to develop their own research project using a method encountered in the course.",

Austronesian is the world's largest language family in terms of geographical spread, spanning more than half the globe: from Madagascar to Easter Island, and from Taiwan to New Zealand. This vast and diverse language family is also one of the best documented. It includes both major world languages with millions of speakers, like Indonesian and Tagalog, and tiny Oceanic languages spoken on a remote island with only a couple of hundred speakers. During the course students will learn about the migration and dispersion of the Austronesian people and salient features characterising their languages, social organisations and cultures. Case studies are used to represent certain salient Austronesian features in relation to particular (sub)regions and societies to cover topics in Austronesian sound systems and grammars, writing systems, ritual language and religions, language contact and change, language ecology, the politics of language, language landscape and verbal arts.",

What psycholinguistic processes explain an utterance such as \"Nail polish me!\" or \"We holded the baby\u00a0 rabbits\"? What conclusions can we draw about what is universal in language development versus what is language or culture specific? Do children always imitate their care-givers or do they bring innovations into a language?

These 800 languages belong to perhaps 45 distinct language families and, in around 1% of the world's land area, exhibit a degree of genetic and typological diversity found for the whole of Eurasia. The course will serve both to initiate students into the descriptive and comparative typological study of the Papuan languages and to consolidate and advance their understanding of the principles of language analysis and linguistic theory based on the data from the Papuan languages. It will run along two tracks: (i) a language-specific track, where we will gain in-depth familiarity with one Papuan language (choice will vary from year to year), and (ii) a broad survey of the nature of Papuan languages and the special analytic challenges that they raise for all areas of linguistic science, from phonetics/phonology through morphosyntax and semantics to studies of multilingualism, typology and the mechanisms that create linguistic diversity.",

What is the relationship in the mind between established and new language patterns? How can we learn languages more effectively? This course offers insight into these and other questions through examining theoretical approaches, empirical methods and findings in second language acquisition research. Topics include features of language learners and their learning processes (e.g., age, crosslinguistic influences), individual influences on language development (e.g., motivation, aptitude) and social dimensions (e.g., identity, community). Students will be encouraged to reflect critically on their own experiences as language learners and/or their experiences in relevant professional capacities. Students will have an opportunity to carry out a small research project on an aspect of language learning that interests them.",

The course considers the relationship between the Indonesian language, culture, and communication in dynamic contexts. Important aspects of Indonesian phonetics, phonology, morphology and syntax are covered, including a description of its lexical, phonetic, and structural variation across registers (standard vs. colloquial) and geographical dialects in the Indonesian archipelago (including regional Malay varieties, such as Kupang and Papuan Malay). The course also covers the historical-cultural-political dimensions that have shaped Indonesian, including language policy and the influence of foreign languages on its vocabulary (e.g., Sanskrit, Arabic, Dutch and English). All classes are taught in a mixture of lecture, student presentation and workshop formats.\n\nThis course is for linguistics students and advanced students of Indonesian. The language of instruction is English, but the advanced students of Indonesian will complete their assessments in Indonesian.\u00a0",

This course is aimed at a better understanding of Islam, Islamic movements, Islamic revivalism or Islamism in a variety of settings. \u00a0Specifically, it is a course about how to think about Islamic radicalism as a conglomeration of context-specific policies, projects, ideals, institutions, and movements that have their origin in Muslim societies\u2019 response to \u201cmodernity\u201d. \u00a0It is designed to introduce students to major theoretical perspectives on Islamism, and its practical manifestations in individual countries (not confined to the Arab World), as well as in the regional and global arena.",

The opening up of the region\u2019s hydrocarbon reserves represents one of the most significant consequences of the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse in 1991. Potential benefits from energy development to national and commercial entities are enormous, but so are the challenges stemming from the expansion of global economy, international and intra-regional competition, and the internal political dynamics of the Caspian states. The region is at the crossroads: from its current volatile situation, it could evolve either as an area of crisis, or as a zone of stability. The dynamics of energy development will be crucial for determining the actual outcome.\nThe course will address the politics of hydrocarbons in the Caucasus and Central Asia as a security problem. While substantial attention will be paid to the traditional balance-of-power contest involving external states, such as Russia, the USA, China, Turkey, and Iran, it will attempt to go beyond pure geopolitics and address broader questions: Is energy development making conflict more or less likely in the region? What will be the domestic impact of the expected hydrocarbon boom? What are the implications for the human and natural environment?\n\t\u00a0",

The other marked component of the year is the presentation of a recent research paper to foster skills in critical analysis of the literature. Most students in this honours course are expected to be doing projects with supervisors based in the John Curtin School of Medical Research, in the disciplines of Cancer Biology and Therapeutics, Genome Biology, Immunology and Infectious Diseases, or Neuroscience. However projects may be undertaken in laboratories in the Research School of Biology, other Schools at ANU where a group has a focus on medical research, or The Canberra Hospital at the discretion of the convenor.

            "description": "Sustainability has moved to centre stage in recent years generating much public discussion and increased the focus on firm impacts and responsibilities and consumer choice processes. Increased awareness of the significant environmental degradation, decline of natural systems and resources along with community, national and global social inequalities has placed a focus on sustainable business practices. For many marketing has been perceived as part of the problem rather than the solution to issues such as pollution, over consumption, the depletion of natural resource, unhealthy lifestyles, and human rights abuses. However, markets provide a coordinating mechanism through which change takes place. Importantly marketing systems provide the crucial link between market participants including individuals, households, managers, and firms.\n\u00a0\nThis course aims to promote an understanding in the organisation, within the context of a capitalist market economy, of: \nchanging consumers attitudes and behaviour, including current unsustainable lifestyles and consumption and the emergence of new forms of consumptionhow marketing can create value sustainablythe role of marketing and marketers in meeting net zero objectives incorporating sustainability into marketing activities and strategies; in order to respond to opportunities and threats that arise from both social, economic and environmental change \u2013 such as climate changeethical issues in marketing decision making, behaviour, and practice\n\u00a0\nAnd provide an introduction to:\nthe principle \u2018tool kits\u2019 employed by practitioners in pursuing sustainable businesscontemporary best practice in sustainability in marketing, including the role of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Circular Economy, and stakeholder communications\n\u00a0",

            "description": "The objective of this course is to introduce students to the marketing of financial services. All financial institutions, including retail or consumer banks, business and institutional lenders, retirement saving and superannuation fund managers, financial advisers, consumer and business insurers\u00a0and other consumer and corporate finance services, practice some form of marketing. Marketing is the process of creating, communicating, delivering and sustaining value exchanges with customers or critical stakeholders, and capturing value for the firm.\u00a0Some firms market themselves better than others, as evidenced in their ability to capture differential value in their brands.\n\nThis course will highlight the contribution of marketing to the success of the firm and its business model.\u00a0It demonstrate to students the benefits of using an analytical approach to marketing in the financial services industry, and will show students how to undertake that analysis. An analytical approach helps firms to\u00a0(1) identify marketing options, (2) calibrate the opportunity costs associated with each option, and (3) choose the best option to achieve the firm's business goals.\n\nThis course operationalises several marketing concepts such as segmentation, targeting, and positioning. By the end of this course, students will know how to segment customers, what kind of data are required to do so, what are the different ways to segment, which customers to target, how to determine the best positioning of your brand in customers' minds, how to develop new products/services that add value to consumers and firms, how to price financial products,\u00a0how to efficiently manage multiple brands across multiple segments in order to meet corporate bottom-line goals, how to develop and effectively manage a brand, how to plan and manage distribution and communication channels (including digital channels) and how to align marketing to the organisation\u2019s purpose and social license to operate.\n\nThe pedagogic philosophy in this course is that of learning by doing. Therefore, students will go beyond learning conceptual marketing material to learning how to do marketing, using real and simulated data from the financial services industry.",

The exploration of musical acoustics incorporates aspects of frequency, sound envelopes, and amplitude measurement. These principles then inform a grounding in the key concepts and skills of musical practice, including the consideration of diatonic pitch space, its systems of documentation, and the ways in which we use it to explain relationships between musical sounds. An understanding of the components of sound also informs the ways in which we perceive, analyse, manipulate and articulate the sounds of music. Techniques of critical listening are introduced in multiple contexts, from the exploration of the frequency content of sound through spectral solfege, to the perception of pitch relationships within diatonic pitch space. Techniques for the analysis of musical sound are introduced which are foundational for the future studies of the music practitioner, technologist, and analyst alike.",

As such, in order to pass this course students must, unless they have a relevant medical certificate,\u00a0attend and participate in at least 80% of ensemble rehearsal time in order to pass this course.",

But it also neatly encapsulates the high point of the Western Art Music tradition we know today as \u2018Classical Music\u2019, or, more specifically, the 'Classic-Romantic Era', from the stylistic triumphs of the First Viennese School of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, to the end of common-practice tonality in the Second Viennese School of Schoenberg, Berg and Webern. In addition, it saw the rise of mass popular musical culture, the beginnings of jazz, and the development of many of the key features of the modern music industry as we know it today.This course will give students the opportunity to better understand not just the traditional notions of \u2018classical\u2019 and \u2018romantic\u2019 music, but also the interplay between such music and wider historical narratives that have come profoundly to shape the ways we hear, and understand, Western musical culture.",

Such is the evolutionary nature of music in the digital age that study topics may vary. Current course content includes: a short history of music and digitisation, intellectual property, copyright and ethics; massively collaborative online music production and distribution; case study analyses of music for gaming, music 'apps' and crowd funding for music projects; digital audio visual curation techniques; and, the 'place' of music in social networks, media players and blogs. Learning and teaching activities include lectures, tutorials, practical lab sessions and workshops. Students are assessed on a portfolio of practical work, to include: an individually constructed e-CV; a music current affairs podcast for public broadcast; and, a written essay on an individually negotiated topic.",

Avoiding a chronological or historical approach, this course examines the political significance of popular music through a variety of cultural and contextual lens, including music aesthetics, textual analysis, race, gender and sexuality. Cultural-theoretical backdrops include a consideration of sound recording technology, ethnomusicology, feminism and \u2018queer theory\u2019. Case study examples taken from broad genre spectra will illuminate the social impact of popular music and its relationship[s] to particular cultural themes such as identity, censorship and violence.",

We investigate colonisation, the impact it had and still has on the region, and the different ways it can be understood. In the recent present we examine the new voyages that Pacific people have taken into places like Australia, New Zealand and the United States. In doing so we look at how people move within and between these new boundaries and how Pacific cultures and identities have evolved over time and place. Finally, we bring all of these themes together by examining how the past and the present can help us imagine the future.",

Key thematic areas will include contemporary debates about women\u2019s influence and participation in church and state; gendered economies, kinship and land; transnational and regional feminisms and human rights; gender violence; gender, sexuality, health and HIV; and gender and sexual identities.

Where possible, students will be incorporated into related in-country research projects with the appropriate ethics approval and meeting the required OH&S standards.\nThe course involves 4-5 weeks of intensive teaching and field experience including preparatory lectures and workshops at ANU before departure for the Pacific. We seek to run it as a topics course with options for offerings in Fiji, Solomon Islands, Samoa, Vanuatu, Tonga, New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Hawai\u2019i, Kiribati and Papua New Guinea.\u00a0",

            "description": "Philosophy has always been concerned with exploring fundamental questions about the nature of humanity, questions that still preoccupy us today and inform many of the other disciplines studied at university. This first year course aims to introduce students to philosophical reflection on questions (a) to do with \u2018humanity\u2019 in the sense of an ethical aspiration proper to human existence and the meaning and potential inherent in human life, and (b) how we can hold \u2018humanity\u2019 to be metaphysically unique, both as a civilizational achievement and as opposed to entities such as non-human animals or machines. Being human implies that we can be \u2018inhuman\u2019, by violating a basic ethical code that defines us. What is the status of that code and how does it inform ideas about human rights? How is the ideal of humanity linked to claims about human privilege and difference? And can ideas about the high value of what is properly human effectively license violence against other beings deemed less important or valuable?\u00a0\nIn particular the course will focus on four overlapping topic areas: humanity and rights; humanity and animals; humanity and race; and humanity and gender. Alongside philosophy, works of film and literature will inform the discussion. The course treats philosophical questions as arising out of dense problem areas, often most effectively mapped in literary treatments. Beginning from skepticism that we know what humanity is, or what it is worth, the course probes three intersectional issues - gender, race and animality - that render the practice and grasp of our \u2018humanity\u2019 particularly complex and demanding.\u00a0",

In addition, we will think about how philosophical work in ethics can inform decisions that we regularly make in our lives.",

The Buddhist path consists in the combined practice of philosophical reasoning, ethical practice and meditation. This course will focus on philosophical reasoning. For Buddhists, enlightenment is attained by gaining insight into the nature of reality (metaphysics), knowledge (epistemology), language (philosophy of language) and our ways of living (ethics). These insights are acquired, in large part, by subjecting our beliefs to rational scrutiny. In this course, we critically examine some of the core issues in metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of language and ethics that are elaborated by Buddhist philosophers. The course proceeds by analyzing some core texts of Buddhist philosophy (in English translation) together with some secondary literature. We study Buddhist philosophy not as an item of historical and cultural interest but as an attempt to ascertain how much truth lies in this system of thought. Once we gain an understanding of the views expounded by Buddhist philosophers, we will subject their doctrines to rational scrutiny.",

The course will explore questions of institutional design and public policy in the context of real-world social injustices including social and material inequality; racial, gender, and sexuality-based oppression; and climate change.

It is difficult to understand how minds fit into the physical world and interact with material things. It is hard to explain how minds are capable of representing the world. And it is a deep mystery how conscious experience relates to our bodies and brains. This course will take a philosophical approach to these questions, exploring some of the metaphysical and conceptual issues that underlie psychological and neuroscientific explanations. We will begin by grappling with the Mind/Body problem via discussion of dualism, mind-body identity, functionalism, computationalism and connectionism. We will consider the frame problem and embodied cognition as well as issues concerning mental representation. We will examine the hard problem of consciousness and its central arguments. We will also consider the nature of reductive or mechanistic explanation and how they might bear on the nature and possibilities of free will.\n\u00a0",

In addition, our enquiry extends beyond the works themselves to the meta-philosophical question of the epistemic role of fictions, thought experiments, imaginings and models in \u00a0philosophy and other disciplines such as biology, economics and physics. What, if anything, can thinking about alternative possibilities tell us about the world? Why?",

            "description": "This course examines what it means to be 'rational' in negotiating the world and conducting one's life. At issue is the quality of one\u2019s beliefs, desires and choices about how to act, particularly in the face of uncertainty, and in concert with others.\nPart I is a critical examination of the standard theory of individual rationality - expected utility theory \u2013 that unites and explicates the aforementioned key mental attitudes. This theory stems from the classic work of philosophers/social scientists such as Ramsey, de Finetti and Savage. Contemporary challenges to the standard theory come from diverse directions, with some arguing that the theory is too little constrained and even vacuous, others arguing that it is too rigid, either in its prescriptions for representing and handling uncertainty or else by virtue of being in conflict with some prominent ethical accounts of right action, and yet others arguing that it gives outright bad advice in various special cases. The course considers these challenges to the standard theory and the responses/developments they have inspired.\nPart II turns to rationality in a social context. The initial focus is the theory of games, applicable to cases where what an individual should do depends on what others do, and vice versa. Standard solution concepts for games are introduced, and the collective-action problems that may arise, including possibilities for their resolution, are considered, with an eye to the ethical significance of these scenarios. Finally, the course turns to group choice proper, where individuals effectively join forces and act as a single entity. Here the starting point for investigation is Arrow\u2019s theorem regarding the (im)possibility of an adequate group aggregation of individual attitudes; this invites examination of Arrow\u2019s assumptions, and raises further questions regarding interpersonal comparability and the plausibility of Utilitarianism and other aggregative solutions.\u00a0",

From a legal point of view, the Constitution may refer to a specific document or set of documents.\u00a0 But legal theorists and philosophers recognize that this institutional form is only the tip of the iceberg.\u00a0 Law, as an expression of collective belonging, is constituted through images and metaphors that bring its concepts to life. As the famous frontispiece to Thomas Hobbes' classic work Leviathan depicts, \u2018the body politic' is not a ready-made entity, but a complex composition from disparate elements. The problem of how legal order is generated and maintained brings it into close relationship with social, political and aesthetic forms. The shape of our collective relationship to a legal and social order is constantly being made, remade, and unmade.\nThis course draws on the resources of critical theory, philosophy, aesthetics, and legal scholarship, to interrogate urgent contemporary problems pertaining to the establishment and maintenance of legal order and public identity, examining the terms on which we speak of sovereignty, democracy, rights, citizenship, and State violence.\u00a0 Our interdisciplinary analysis relates these terms to the wider representational frames they inhabit; explores contemporary sites of constitution and deconstitution, including through art, media, and protest; and introduces students to relevant methods and theories.",

In particular, the course examines feminist epistemology, which has had a wide-ranging influence; feminist discourses on power that seek to interpret gendered phenomena in public and private contexts; and theories of the nature and reality of gender. Philosophers have been among the leading theorists of gender (Simone de Beauvoir, Judith Butler, Elizabeth Grosz, for instance) and have advanced important theories of knowledge and power to which gendered relations are central. By paying attention to the explicitly philosophical context from which our most influential accounts of gender arise, students will gain depth and subtlety in their capacity to interpret the nuances of gendered realities.\nThis course will therefore be of interest to students with a background or interest in gender studies as well as to philosophers. It encourages students to think about the complexities of gender, gendered relations, embodiment, inequality and power as these impact how we understand wider questions of social and political order. By philosophically exploring gender as an aspect of knowledge, self-hood, social institutions, and political hierarchy, students will be well placed to critically evaluate key debates around gender in the contemporary world.",

This course aims to introduce students to evolutionary theories of human nature. We will discuss such issues as (i) whether evolutionary theory undermines the very idea of a fairly fixed and universal human nature; (ii) how and why humans came to be so very different from their great ape relatives; (iii) whether the explanatory toolkit that suffices to explain animal evolution suffices to explain human evolution as well, or whether (for example) the importance of culture to humans changes the rules of the evolutionary game; (iv) the extent to which we can have reasonably reliable knowledge of the human past. Students will engage in interdisciplinary work, analysing and responding to research not just in philosophy but also in relevant empirical disciplines, including archaeology, prehistory, palaeoanthropology, and behavioural economics.\u00a0The course with not be considering the creation vs evolution controversy; the basic truth of an evolutionary theory of life will be assumed.\u00a0",

It will also teach you skills and an approach to problem solving that you will take forward in your life.The course offers a unique 'hands on' approach to learning physics. You'll get the background material for each week in a short 1 hour theory lecture, and then have the opportunity, over the course of an afternoon, to put that theory into practice. You'll work in small teams to build, test and analyse physics experiments directly relevant to the material you're learning. Lab manuals and instructions are forbidden! Just like a real researcher.We introduce students to the key concepts in physics in the areas of mechanics, electricity and magnetism. It is an algebra-based course suitable for those who wish to undertake some physics but do not have a strong mathematical background, and great for those keen on entering graduate medicine via the GAMSAT.If you've ever wanted to get a real taste of what physics is all about, this is the course for you.The course is taught by young, enthusiastic and experienced teachers with research interests in quantum mechanics (atom lasers and precision measurement), advanced materials engineering, laser science, and more!",

Many properties of these collections are independent of atomic details: examples are the direction of heat flow, that liquids more readily boil at lower pressure, and that the maximum efficiency of an engine depends upon temperature range and not the working fluid and the set of principles that govern these generic properties is referred to as classical thermodynamics.  Other properties do depend upon atomic details - the framework by which we  relate the quantum behaviour of one individual particle and to properties of a collection of large number of these particles is referred to as statistical mechanics.   From understanding the greenhouse effect to the blackbody radiation left over from the Big Bang, no other physical theory is used more widely through out science than thermal physics.\nThis course provides an introduction to classical thermodynamics, with applications in materials science & engineering and earth science, as well as statistical thermodynamics, with applications in solid state physics and astrophysics.

Hamiltonian mechanics is also introduced, as are the tensor properties of materials. The course examines wave phenomena in continuous media, including diffraction and Fourier theory, and continuum mechanics in fluids. The course material is supported throughout by examples taken from recent research on mechanical systems, nano-optics, atomic physics, biological systems, fluid mechanics and laser physics. Computer models provide an opportunity to explore various concepts presented in lectures, including coupled linear oscillators and chaotic dynamics in driven non-linear oscillators. Complementing the lectures, this course contains a laboratory component. Some experiments are essentially qualitative and support lecture material, while others allow development of important skills in quantitative experimental physics. This course is a prerequisite for PHYS3101 and PHYS3102. It is required for the physics major.",

We explain in this course the origin of particles (why are all electrons identical?), forces (why same charge repel while gravitation is attractive?) and antiparticles. The Feynman path integral formalism is used, leading to Klein-Gordon, Maxwell and Dirac equations. Feynman diagrams to describe interacting fields are also introduced. The concepts of Gauge Invariance, spontaneous symmetry breaking, as well as the Goldstone and Higgs mechanisms are introduced in a general context, and applied, e.g., to describe superfluidity, superconductivity and ferromagnetism.",

Fluid motion is compared and contrasted with the behaviour of plasma, including single particle motion and the behaviour of particles in electric and magnetic fields. There is a direct correspondence between plasma dynamics and ocean/atmosphere flows on the rotating earth, and the remainder of the course focuses on circulation, waves and geophysical/industrial applications of fluids and plasma. The course is supported throughout by examples from simple fluid systems, plasmas used for research and industry and ocean/atmosphere circulation.

The first section looks at different approaches to thinking about international relations and world politics and introduces students to the key actors, agents, institutions and ideas that dominate the world today.\u00a0 The second section, \u2018Crisis and Co-operation\u2019 looks at the sources of international tensions, and the possibilities for global co-operation around major issues such as transnational conflict, international political economy, global environmental management, and human and social rights. In each theme this course examines the history of these major areas of contemporary international relations and the competing debates and agendas within them.\u00a0 It then focuses upon causes and consequences of a contemporary crisis and examines the possibilities of global co-operation in its resolution.",

Covering five countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela), this course will investigate the causes and consequences of populism, revolution, military authoritarian and bureaucratic authoritarian rule, democratisation, and neoliberalism. It will also consider topics such as the 'weak democracy syndrome' plus critical issues for Latin American democracy and development such a violence and insecurity, inequality, social inclusion/exclusion, popular participation, social mobilisations, and the rise of indigenous politics.

The Jewish Holocaust and its seminal place in history and genocide studies will be investigated, as well as more recent case studies. The ideological bases for such killings, questions of responsibility and punishment, and the structures and processes that have developed in response to genocide will be addressed through the case studies. The course will also explore debates about the definition of genocide and the political, legal and moral implications of different approaches to definition.\u00a0",

In answering the first question we will explore recent examples of asylum seeking, state building and international law. In answering the second question we will look at the impacts of globalisation, war, persecution, poverty and environmental change on people flows. In answering the third question we will assess border protection, international organisations, and refugee advocacy. The interaction of concepts and case studies will illuminate the dynamics of political belonging and exclusion in international relations.",

The course begins by exploring the range of different understandings of the roots of violence and the contemporary manifestations of conflict. It\u00a0 then examines the key actors in conflicts such as elites, constituencies, civil society, soldiers, mercenaries, spoilers and outside actors. Turning to major debates in the field, it explores the question of whether it is ever 'just' to use violence for political ends; the concept of 'non-violence' in theory and practice; and debates over external intervention (including the R2P debate, various 'soft' and 'hard' power approaches and the role and efficacy of the UN). We then investigate key approaches in the field - such as conflict prevention, conflict management, conflict resolution and conflict transformation (and the relationship between these approaches). The role that human security, human rights and international law plays in such processes is also examined. The course then turns to the relationship that conflict resolution has to peacekeeping, peace-enforcing and post-conflict situations. Integral to these discussions is the application of theory to case-studies such as Israel-Palestine, South Africa, Northern Ireland, Afghanistan, Iraq East Timor, Sri Lanka and Rwanda. The final part of the course assesses the future of conflict and conflict prevention.",

The point of departure of this course is women\u2019s long-standing underrepresentation in politics and its consequences for political research. The focus is on a comparative analysis of gender and politics; however, on many occasions we will draw on specific country experiences, including Australia, to illustrate particular topics. Issues of global importance will be discussed such as social movement, representation, elections, political parties, public policies, body politics, and LGBTIQ. The course will emphasise the theoretical, methodological and empirical contributions of gender and feminist approaches to political science.\u00a0",

This course will focus on the political and social inclusion of migrant and ethnic minority (MEM) groups in Australia and other countries. It considers such questions as: Are there differences in the participation and voting behaviours of members from migrant and ethnic minority groups, compared to other citizens? Is there such a thing as the \u2018ethnic vote\u2019? What are the political behaviours of ethnic, \u2018racial\u2019 and religious minorities in comparison to citizens from majority groups? What are the sources of mobilization for minority political participation? What are the individual, cultural and structural barriers to full participation among MEM groups within Western democracies? \u00a0The course considers these questions in both an Australian and comparative context, and looks carefully at how contextual differences matter.\nThe course is designed both as an exercise in covering the theory and literature in the field, and as a vehicle for encouraging research in migration politics. With respect to theory, the course covers themes in comparative and Australian political science including mass political behaviour, parties and party systems, parliamentary systems, elections and electoral systems, representation, legislative behaviour, social capital, identity politics, political elites, citizenship frameworks and immigration policies. With respect to research, the course includes online tasks that are designed to help you engage in research on significant questions regarding the political participation of minority groups in Australia and in comparative perspective.\u00a0",

Does China's rapidly growing economy\u00a0endow it with a potent economic instrument of power? Is the soft power of the West declining amid global financial crisis and domestic political turmoil? Who is winning the contest of great powers in the 21st century? This course focuses on puzzles like these, examining how power is accumulated and wielded in international relations, and the conditions under which its use can be successful. States are the primary focus of the course, and five primary modes of power will be studied: military power, economic power, technological power, soft power and hegemonic power. The objective of this course is to provide the student with a broad and deep understanding of how power can be conceptualised, measured, and deployed in international relations, and the conditions for its successful use. The course considers a wide range of contemporary issues and case studies and will analyse both the capacity of and limitations on states to wield different types of power successfully.",

Theories provide frameworks to understand the behaviour of actors in a complex and dynamic global environment. Distinct theoretical paradigms make central assumptions about primary factors that drive human action with implications for how we understand, explain, and predict issues and interactions in the international arena. Such factors range from scarcity and a drive for control (e.g., classical realism, neorealism, game theory); to a drive to cooperate for absolute gains (e.g., neoliberal institutionalism, liberalism), constructed identities based on historically-contingent meanings and values (e.g., constructivism), and unequal power relations that underpin a drive for autonomy, agency, and empowerment. (e.g., critical theories, feminist theory). The course teaches all theoretical paradigms with a focus on how they can be applied to better understand political issues and challenges in the contemporary global environment.",

Within federal configurations, power and resources can simultaneously shift downwards (towards local government) and upwards towards the center. Why would the center concede power to subnational units or vice versa? In this course, we will explore the logic of power-sharing and the motives (causes) that drive it from two different theoretical perspectives that are grounded in experience: rational choice (American) and historical institutionalism (European). In the final stages of the course we will begin to look at the impact (consequences) of federalism on democracy and democratic representation, economic stability, and redistribution. By doing so, we will be examining one of the most dynamic research areas at the intersection of political science and economics. We will examine both the normative theories of federalism and how it is applied in practice to countries such as Australia, Canada, and the US, and in emerging federations such as Brazil and Argentina. Australian federalism will be a focus of this course, and will provide students with a unique opportunity to design (reform) the Australian Federation.",

Rather, the course goes beyond the conventional black letter approach and focuses on the political contexts, causes, and consequences of international law, thereby bridging international politics and international law. The course is structured in three parts. First, we will focus on the different theoretical perspectives in International Relations for understanding international law, such as realist, liberal, and constructivist approaches. Second, the course will examine the general principles of international law, including actors of international law, the creation and sources of international law, international law interpretation, the relationship between international and national law, and the problem of compliance. Third, we will examine the interrelationships between international politics and international law in several specialized areas of international law, such as human rights, the environment, international criminal justice, trade, and/or the use of force.",

The objective of the course is to provide the student with a broad understanding of international terrorism, and to enhance the ability to engage knowledgeably in discussion and debate on the subject. The course considers a wide range of questions in order to provide students with a deeper understanding of the threat of terrorism today. Among the questions it examines are:\nHow has terrorism evolved over time as a mode of political violence?What are the defining features of modern terrorism, including ideological principles, political motivations and organisational structure?What are the challenges associated with modern counter-terroism responses?\nSpecifically, the course will analyse both terrorism\u2019s effectiveness as a means to achieve political change and the challenges faced by the liberal democratic state in responding to domestic and/or international terrorist campaigns.",

Specific topics include how the relationship between communication and power affects questions of democracy, political empowerment, identity formation, propaganda and public opinion. The course then looks at the role of communication in the organisation of governance and politics before branching out to examine the relationship between communication and globalisation, including the literature on cultural imperialism, global culture and the network society.",

Unlike what often appears in the press, Africa is not all conflict, famine, and state collapse. This class offers an overview of both successful and unsuccessful cases of political and economic development in this region and seeks to answer a number of questions including: What are the legacies of colonial rule? Why do some African countries suffer political violence more frequently than other countries within Africa or without? Why has democracy been consolidated in certain African countries but regressed or collapsed in others? What accounts for the failures and successes of African countries\u2019 economic development? How have international actors and events affected African politics and society?\n\u00a0\nThe class organized into three main sections. We start by considering the political legacies of pre-colonial societies, colonial rule, independence, and the recent decades of economic and political change. The second section introduces theoretical causes for some of Africa\u2019s political conflicts including institutional, political, economic, and structural factors. In the third section we consider issues related to political and economic change including democratic transitions and electoral politics, economic growth and foreign assistance, and regional efforts towards political and economic cooperation.",

It takes participants through a series of core texts from the last fifty years concerning how democracy is best defined, how and under what conditions democratic regimes come into place and break down, and how democracy interacts with other important political and social phenomena (such as inequality and ethnicity), as well as on authoritarian alternatives to democracy. The later parts of the course focus on contemporary challenges facing democracy worldwide. Students will be expected to critically assess alternative approaches to the study of democratic regimes and breakdown, and to apply the theories they encounter through comparative analysis of historical and contemporary cases.",

In the final stages of the course we will begin to look at the impact (consequences) of federalism on democracy and democratic representation, economic stability, and redistribution.

Most theories of political order begin with the perspective that state institutions set limits on the legitimate use of violence and so control the violent tendencies of an anarchic society. Yet state building is itself a deeply violent process. Moreover the state continues to be a prolific user of violence. Aside from the obvious case of war between states, both democratic and authoritarian states engage in varying levels of everyday violence. In some cases, this violence is perceived as legitimate, as in the use of imprisonment as a punishment for criminal activity. In other cases, states transgress norms of legitimate violence, engaging in activities such as torture, sexual violence, and even ethnic cleansing. This course will cover topics including state building, torture, civil war, and crime and punishment. We will read work from political science, political economy, political sociology and political theory. This is a reading intensive seminar.",

Data sources for qualitative research include archives and other written sources, interviews, and ethnographic fieldwork. Students will learn the pros and cons of each method and the different ontologies and epistemologies underpinning them, read exemplary works, and apply the methods in assignments. The analysis of qualitative data also poses special challenges. Students will gain exposure to various methods of data analysis including historical process tracing, discourse and narrative analysis, and content analysis.",

            "description": "The 20th Century witnessed profound challenges to classical knowledge paradigms in the social sciences. Approaches to the study of society and politics diversified. Critical, social, post-structuralist, post-colonial and \u2018post-modern\u2019 interventions drew attention to structures and practices of meaning-making and to the relationship between knowledge paradigms and power. Interpretivist scholars made substantial contributions to developments in the theories of language and communication, and in the 'second order observation' involved in varieties of discourse analysis. Scholars across a variety of disciplines are working in interpretivist traditions that depart from the\u00a0 positivist paradigm adopted constructivist, thick descriptive, inductive and context-based approaches to assess, explain and understand sites and assemblages of \u2018meaning making\u2019. \u00a0\nThe aim of this course is to\u00a0 introduce students to the long tradition of Interpretivist Social Science, and to invite them to consider how its theoretical claims might inform their own epistemological and methodological decisions. The course offers practical training for students interested in modes of enquiry into the increasingly communicative, media driven, institutional and text based world in which we live that are not covered by conventional quantitative and qualitative approaches. In addition to equipping students with skills for interpretivist research design, data generation, analysis, inference, interpretation and critique, it addresses fundamental questions about the logic, conduct and significance of social scientific inquiry and the politics of knowledge in the 20th and 21st Centuries.",

Among these factors are developing the ability to:\u2022 have a deep sense of self-acceptance,\u2022 experience positive emotions,\u2022 be fully engaged in life,\u2022 have positive relationships with others,\u2022 experience a sense of accomplishment,\u2022 have a sense that your life is valuable and meaningful,\u2022 experience personal growth through life\u2019s difficulties,\u2022 have a sense of being in charge of your own life, and\u2022 optimise your physical health.\nIn addition to its focus on psychological factors, the course will address sociocultural factors in terms of the societal determinants of wellbeing and how to build flourishing communities and societies. More than helping you to gain an intellectual understanding of the science of wellbeing, this course will also provide instruction in key strategies whereby you can understand the processes involved in enhancing your own wellbeing and that of others. This course will move away from a more traditional focus on illness to one on health, from what causes us to experience distress to what protects us against distress, from a focus on eliminating problems to cultivating strengths, and from how our suffering can be minimised to how we can thrive.",

Students will engage in depth in the analysis of the social and psychological process of social categorization into groups, the interdependencies between individuals and groups, and the cognitive, attitudinal and behavioural consequences of both social categorization and social interdependence. Throughout the course, students will have the opportunity to examine current understandings of group interactions (e.g., deviance, norms, & decision making), pro-social behaviours (e.g., cooperation, helping, trust, & fairness), social change and collective action, social influence, and stereotyping and prejudice. The course, itself, strongly integrates theory with laboratory and field data, allowing students to gain a solid understanding of advanced, contemporary insights into a range of social behaviours.\n\nA key feature of this course is its emphasis on the importance of theory in developing an understanding of group life. This emphasis on theory, however, is balanced by a rigorous laboratory program designed to complement the lectures, while simultaneously providing hands-on lessons in experimental social psychology. Throughout the course, students will design an experiment; complete a Human Research Ethics Application; and write a formal research report Introduction, hypothesis, Methods and Results. Students will learn key features of social-psychological experimental design, including the manipulation and measurement of variables of interest, scale construction, hypothesis testing, data interpretation, as well as abstract methodological concepts such as \u201cmediation\u201d and \u201cmoderation\u201d.\n\nCritically, this course not only provides students with a supported and structured environment in which to gain a deep understanding of the social psychology of group life, but it equips students with a variety of graduate attributes (also known as employability skills) identified as important for the development of a productive workforce. Specifically, students develop an ability to communicate effectively and contribute to scholarship in social psychology; to solve problems, take individual initiative, and think critically; to understand ethical values in research; and to make sense of evidence. Achieving at high levels in this course requires good self-management, planning and organization skills.\n\nThis is an Honours Pathway Course.",

These two topics are addressed in distinct modules because traditionally these topics have been approached in different ways, but here they are combined into a single course to highlight that considering them in synergy is the most powerful way to understand the nexus between psychological function and the brain.\nTopics covered in the visual neuroscience section include: learning the practical skills in designing and running psychophysical studies, understanding the neural machinery underlying the perception of objects, depth, and motion, and an explanation of sensory and perceptual illusions and what they tell us about the brain. The cognitive neuroscience section will focus on contemporary issues and therefore the content is subject to change. Indicative examples of content include using knowledge of brain structure and function to understand visual attention and predict task performance, how the human body alters what we see and how we think, and how cognitive neuroscience can inform our understanding of neurological conditions.\n\nThis is an Honours Pathway Course.",

There is a recognition that Industrial and Organisational psychology are concerned with the impact of organisational strategy and culture, structures, and processes on the motivation and behaviour of the individual (and vice versa) and not the study of the individual in isolation (e.g., individual counselling in a work context).\n\u00a0\nIn lectures students can expect to gain an overview of key topics in Industrial and Organisational Psychology and in the laboratory program more practical know-how about how to effectively work with others in a team environment (team work, leadership dynamics, giving and receiving feedback). Many aspects of the laboratory program will mirror management-type training with group exercises followed by discussion and exploration of team dynamics.

It\u2019s designed to help you taste a little bit of everything and see what flavours of science communication most appeal to you!\n\u00a0\nSCOM1001 provides an introduction to contemporary social and communication issues in science, technology, and society. In the course, we will ask a whole range of questions, like:\nWhy communicate science with the public, the media or the government?\u00a0What are the best ways to go about it and what are the potential pitfalls?\u00a0How do we make sense of science as it flies between, and well beyond, the lab?What kinds of factors affect public attitudes to science?\u00a0Is it OK to be a scientist and have influence beyond your scientific expertise?Just what is \u201cthe public\u201d anyway?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTopics include: the history of science communication; competing theories of what science communication is for; different models of effective science communication; obstacles facing scientists wanting to communicate their work; practical skills for communicating science via multiple platforms and venues; the different languages of science; cross-cultural considerations when communicating science; and the influence of popular media, science centres, politics, history, and cultural values on the public context of science communication.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFocusing on current events and issues facing scientists, science communicators, policy makers, and the community, SCOM1001 students are encouraged to discuss their own perceptions of science and technology in the context of society, and the problems with (and solutions to) communicating science with non-expert audiences. A strong emphasis is placed on collaboration with other students, and students are expected to take an active approach to learning.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSCOM1001 is also a solid foundation for a Major or Minor in science communication, and for working towards a science communication career. Science communication is a growing area of employment, as science organisations continue to realise the importance of communicating about their work with the public, the media, governments, business, clients, patients, community groups and other stakeholders.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nScience communication graduates have built careers as health promoters, environmental lobbyists or activists, science journalists, science presenters, communications officers for science organisations, science policy analysts working in government, and more. Of course, the skills, ideas, and approaches offered by studying some introductory science communication will also help you if you want to be a research scientist!",

Dig a little deeper and it becomes clear that scientific evidence is often misunderstood, misused, misappropriated or ignored, especially in public and political domains. The consequences of this can range from the merely quirky to the manifestly dangerous.Scientific evidence is increasingly wielded in arguments in the public domain, and the calls for \u2018evidenced based decisions\u2019 have never been so frequent, so broad, or so loud. To operate effectively in such an environment, today\u2019s science communicators must be able to tell the difference between good research and bad, even if that research falls beyond their personal scientific skillset and experience. \u00a0They must possess the skills and knowledge to critique the evidence at the base of science-related issues affecting society today. In parallel, they need to understand, and be able to apply, science communication research to their own communication practice.This course emphasizes the analysis, critique and communication of science and scientific evidence in the context of identifying, understanding and critiquing examples of social influence and change.The course focuses on cases of critical societal challenges that have significant science bases such as\u2022 Climate change\u2022 Alternative energy\u2022 Public health (e.g., vitamin supplements, vaccination, homeopathic remedies)\u2022 Natural disaster mitigation and survival (e.g., bushfires, tsunamis)\u2022 Health and safety legislation (e.g., illicit drugs, road safety, GM foods)\u2022 The role of scientific research in society (e.g., curiosity driven versus applied)To be able to successfully appraise the relative merits of evidence, both for scientific and science communication research, students in this course will be exposed to the philosophy and reasoning behind common quantitative and qualitative methods and methodological argument.Scientific research, analysis and communication will be considered from the multiple, sometimes conflicting, perspectives of formal researchers, politicians, the media, and society at large.",

How might The Day After Tomorrow impact the public understanding of climate change?\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the impact of fictional representations of science and scientists on public perceptions of science. It introduces research, theory and methods from this growing area of science communication as applied to fictional works including films, television programs, plays, novels, short stories and comics. Students are encouraged to share their own experiences of science-based fiction and to pursue their areas of interest through assessment. The major piece of assessment is a research project testing students' hypotheses about the impact that a work of fiction might have on public perceptions of science. The research project will be completed individually, but there will be an option to develop the research ideas as a team with a view to obtaining publishable results.\n\n",

The course thus investigates both, the ways science has influenced and generated rich and fascinating comic traditions in popular culture, and how humour and comic performance have shaped cultural ideas of sciences and \u2018science humour\u2019. It looks at the exchange between popular entertainment and science in various media (e.g. comics, film, fiction) over the last 150 years \u2013 the course is a conversation between the past, present and future \u2013 and clarifies the power of humour for bringing science and scientists into the general public discussion.",

However, in the sciences, we cannot afford to be so blas\u00e9. The ramifications of poor risk assessment (and communication) in science can and do have dramatic, global consequences. Risk is very hard to calculate, and even harder to communicate. What is risky, to whom, and why? How is risk understood by experts? How does it manifest in public domains? When does a risk become acceptable? Is it possible to speak about \u201creal\u201d or \u201ctrue\u201d risks in science? How do the concepts of risk and ethics relate?\n\u00a0\nIn recent years, issues such as climate change, environmental degradation and gene/ nano-technologies have regularly highlighted the need for society to challenge and address risks and ethics in the sciences. In this course, the practice and application of science is analyzed from risk communication and ethical perspectives. Consideration is given to how social, political and psychological contexts of scientific research influence contemporary debates about risk and ethics. The concept of ethical research is analyzed and critiqued and the communication of risk and uncertainty with lay publics is examined in detail. Throughout the course, significant attention is devoted to the consideration of clear and effective ways to characterize and communicate controversial, risky, and ethically charged science-based matters in the public sphere.

Students will devise their own science communication research project in collaboration with the supervisor, or can pursue a topic already offered by the supervisor.\nThe course can be taken as 6 or 12 units:\nA 6-unit project can take the form of a comprehensive literature review, a content analysis, the creation and evaluation of a science communication tool or artefact, or similar - research projects that do not involve human participants except in some cases a small pilot test.The 12-unit version of the course is reserved for projects that involve a prominent human participant component and therefore require the student to apply for, and receive, ethics approval. This includes all focus group, survey and interview-based projects. In rare cases students may be offered the 12 unit version if there are other methodological reasons that necessitate more time be devoted to the project. Each project must be completed within a single semester, with the rare exception of longitudinal human participant studies for which a longer time frame is genuinely required to complete the project.\nIf the work produced is of a sufficient standard, students may be offered the opportunity to co-publish it with their supervisor. All research projects must be undertaken with appropriate ethics approval to facilitate potential future publication of data.\nStudents must discuss their project ideas with the course convener prior to enrolling in the course to ensure they enrol in the appropriate version and that a supervisor is available.\nThis is an Honours Pathway Course.",

As well as providing a theoretical understanding informed by Science and Technology Studies, this course will provide you with the skills to plan, design and run science dialogue. It will also give you opportunities to learn and practice skills needed to participate in and facilitate dialogue. Assessment items will require students to plan and conduct a mini-dialogue.\n\t\u00a0\n\tScience dialogue refers to communication about science that brings all parties to greater understanding. The key feature is that science dialogue is bi-directional - \u00a0information and insights are gained on both 'sides'. In the case of dialogue between scientists or science communicators and members of the public, then, the public participants learn about the science and the scientists' aims and aspirations, and the scientists learn something from the public, about their concerns and aspirations and generally about the social context of the science, which informs their thinking, and potentially their decisions, about that science. Dialogue has a special place within science communication as a communication medium with particular aims that is increasingly being promoted as a best practice approach within government and community sectors.",

            "description": "Politicians, chief scientists and others are increasingly calling for scientists to communicate their work with the public, but how, where and when did this start? Can we draw connections between things like eighteenth century British amateur science and citizen science today, or nineteenth century French science popularisation and today's science journalism? Can we identify histories of science communication-type practices for knowledge systems across the world beyond Western science, such as Australian Indigenous ecological and astronomical knowledges, Chinese engineering techniques or Islamic world mathematical methods? And how important is communication to these scientific traditions? Is science communication an added extra in the world of science, or integral to its success and longevity? How can we map institutional relationships between science and the bodies that promote it, popularise it, and link it to political processes? Thinking globally, how was 'modern science' made, in all these ways?\nThis course applies historical and institutional approaches to science communication to explore the big picture view of how this discipline and its professional practices have developed across the world and through time. You will map the relationships between science and the science communication-type activities and organisations that have always surrounded and supported western science as an institutionalised pursuit - scientific societies, advocacy for science funding, science professionalisation measures, science popularisation efforts of different kinds, science museums and centres, and more. You will also look at communication practices in knowledge systems beyond the modern West to develop long term, cross-cultural histories of science communication. Course assessment emphasises reflection on the significance of this big picture for professional practice in science communication, as well as developing science communication research skills.",

We will explore the complex relationship that exists between the individual and the wider society in which they are embedded. We will look at how people experience social life very differently as a consequence of where they live and what identity they embody and choose (or are obliged) to present. This means observing how social factors like sex, gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexuality, disability, health and socioeconomic status mediate the treatment people receive from institutions and organisations and operate to shape their everyday experiences.\nWe will contemplate how exposure to culture socialises individuals into adopting particular values, sentiments and belief systems, perceptions and understandings of the social world that inform the way people behave in various contexts. This focus invites us to think about the diverse forms of power that operate in society, in terms of who has privileged access to 'the truth' and to constructing and disseminating this knowledge, and who is marginalised or excluded from the process, and what factors account for this asymmetry.\n\u00a0Overall, the course will provide a greater understanding of:\n1. what sociology is (and does) and what makes it unique when compared to other disciplines like anthropology and psychology;\n2. what types of questions sociologists ask, what research approaches they adopt and what kinds of social behaviour, events and problems they analyse;\n3. how sociological knowledge impacts on society.",

It addresses the question of why addiction and drug use have such prominence as medical and social problems in contemporary Western cultures and provides a range of concepts and tools for understanding their significance. The course will investigate the continued debates about 'what' addiction is and what these debates reveal about medical science and conceptions of health. It will also introduce the idea of alcohol and drug use as socio-cultural practices which occur within specific social contexts. The significance of gender, race, age and class in structuring patterns and experiences of drug use will be explored.",

And yet, we know very little about how surveillance operates and how the data these systems produce are used to positively and negatively structure our social experiences, in terms of how we are viewed and responded to by other actors and agencies. Personal data are a means of knowledge and power and they are put to many different ends, from governing large populations to staging individual constructions of identity.\n\nThis course considers some of the key historical events, organisational aspirations and cultural factors responsible for the emergence of surveillance societies. Students will learn about the political, social, legal and ethical dimensions and implications of mass surveillance, specifically by drawing on some of the major theories in surveillance studies. We explore the interests and values underpinning the expansion of surveillance, the types of regulatory frameworks governing surveillance and the complex forms of social relations mediating surveillance processes. We will focus on various research examples to develop our knowledge and understanding of the social drivers and implications of surveillance.\n\nThe four main questions informing our coverage are:\n1. What social and historical circumstances have generated the surveillance society?\n2. How did mass surveillance of everyday life become so normal?\n3. What purposes and interests does surveillance serve?\n4. How does surveillance operate and with what social consequences?",

In asking this question Contemporary Social Theory puts forward a case for the practical value of theory. It is not simply that empirical problems exist \u2018out there\u2019 in the world awaiting analysis, but the way that we figure and think through a problem is a good part of its solution. Most importantly, then, the course aims to develop skills and give you confidence in your capacity to think, so that you can engage with issues and empirical problems in an original way.\u00a0\nWhile Contemporary Social Theory covers some of the important thinkers of the post- war period, its aim is not to provide a comprehensive survey of the vast array of social theorists that you might find in a text on social or sociological theory. The idea is to expose you to some of the key problems that have animated sociology and cognate disciplines in recent years, with the hope that you might have a window into these and similar theoretical and practical problems. On the way through the course, we will pay attention to the question of what it means for thinking to be \u2018contemporary\u2019. The issue of how we grasp what \u2018our present\u2019 is raises important questions about who the \u2018we\u2019 is here, as well as the relationship between thinking and time. In exploring these and other theoretical questions, the course will relate key theoretical problems to diverse empirical examples - from consumerism and globalisation to terrorism, the information and genetic revolutions and the role of science - with the hope that it will bring the theories alive for you.\u00a0",

But is this sufficient?2) Intellectual and 'cultural' populism: the celebration of all things 'authentic' and 'direct', most notably in the case of popular music, but often in all forms of popular culture.3) The problem of 'simulated authenticity': how can anything be authentically 'of the people'. What role do different forms of media, including journalism, play here?4) The dark side of populism: the scapegoating of those deemed 'enemies of the people' by populist demagogues inside and outside politics.",

This involves utilising specific research methods and conceptual frameworks to analyse expressions of power, modes of resistance and dynamics of social change. But it also entails applying knowledge, aptitudes and critical thought derived from this field of study to impact positively on the nature and arrangement of contemporary social life in a global era. \u00a0Sociologists are interested in not only interpreting social patterns, but in using this insight to transform society. This is what \u00a0doing 'public sociology' \u00a0is all about. In this advanced course students will be \u00a0introduced to the notions of 'public sociology', 'action research' and 'social movements', and will explore the diverse practices that comprise each of these political and substantive projects. They will be shown the distinct ways in which sociologists have \u00a0contributed to public and policy understandings of - and responses to - key social issues such as climate change, poverty, gender relations, crime and security . Students will also be exposed to different sites of sociological engagement such as \u00a0education, research, media engagement, employment, policy lobbying, action research, protest, performance and NGO participation and the different tools required to participate in these arenas. \u00a0\n\t\u00a0\n\tA key facet of this course is to develop students' comprehension of the professional 'identity' and 'project' of the sociologist, and to provide tangible resources that will enable them to influence specific social matters.

Applications presented may include topics such as high-dimensional statistical inference, large covariance matrices, large-scale statistical learning through subsampling, sparsification of large matrices, principal component analysis, and dimension reduction.\n \n We conclude with an introduction to the theory of online learning (aka. sequential prediction) to handle the situation of streaming data.\n \n Students will use and learn about the latest computational tools to work with big and streaming data sets.

This way, we can incorporate prior knowledge on the unknown parameters before observing any data. Statistical inference is summarised by the posterior distribution of the parameters after data collection, and posterior predictions for new observations. The Bayesian approach to statistics is very flexible because we can describe the probability distribution of any function of the unknown parameters in the model. Modern advances in computing have allowed many complicated models, which are difficult to analyse using 'classical' (frequentist) methods, to be readily analysed using Bayesian methodology.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe aim of this course is to equip students with the skills to perform and interpret Bayesian statistical analyses. The first part of the course is devoted to describing the fundamentals of Bayesian inference by examining some simple Bayesian models. More complicated models will then be explored, including linear regression and hierarchical models in a Bayesian framework. Bayesian computational methods, especially Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods will progressively be introduced as motivated by the models discussed. Emphasis will also be placed on model checking and evaluation.",

Yet the Cold War never really ended in the Asia-Pacific region. Its legacy is still very much apparent in the form of the U.S.-led bilateral network of security alliances and with the persistence of dangerous flashpoints around the Korean Peninsula and across the Taiwan Strait. Longstanding historical tensions persist between Japan and Korea, China and Japan and India and Pakistan, to name just a few.\n In this course, students will learn about five security concepts and their relevance to security in the Asia-Pacific region. These concepts are order/hierarchy, alliances, polarity/balance of power, international reputation (\"credibility\"), and historical memory. We will explore these concepts through case studies such as the Korean War, the Taiwan Strait crises, the history (and future) of alliances in Asia, the Vietnam War, the Sino-U.S. rapprochement, the post-war order, and territorial disputes.

            "description": "Australian governments have consistently identified the island chain to the north of Australia, ranging from Indonesia through the Pacific Islands to New Zealand, as the region from or through which a security threat to Australia could most easily be posed.\u00a0As a result, Australia is engaged in extensive efforts to support stability and security in this region, which has been the site of significant Australian military deployments and policing operations, and remains a focus for Australia\u2019s development expenditure.\u00a0At the same time, recent years have seen a rise in engagement by \u2018non-traditional\u2019 powers in the Pacific islands, in particular China, which some observers have seen as threatening Australia\u2019s interests\u00a0in the region.\u00a0This course critically analyses the security challenges facing this region and, in particular, Australia\u2019s role in the security of the region.\u00a0This includes cooperation on transnational crime and counterterrorism; intervention and stabilisation; criminal justice assistance; governance capacity-building; natural disaster response; and substantial development assistance.\u00a0The course considers ways in which Pacific understandings of security differ from Australia\u2019s, and the implications of this for Australia\u2019s engagement with Pacific Island governments, security agencies and societies.\u00a0It also assesses the outlook over the next decade for security in this strategically important and rapidly changing region.",

Through meetings with experts and visits to key sites, they will encounter the complexity of Southeast Asian approaches to security, including the legacies of colonialism, decolonisation, political ideology, geostrategic location, ethnic makeup, civil-military relations and religion. While some Southeast Asian states struggle with internal conflict, ASEAN as a whole has experienced remarkably peaceful interstate relations. Students will examine what has sustained peace, and consider whether it can be continued. Students will look at how ASEAN contributes to managing intra-Southeast Asian relations, and how Southeast Asia manages its relations with external\npowers, whether through hosting the ASEAN Regional Forum or the East Asia Summit. It will also consider the shifting geopolitical orientations of Southeast Asian states, as all adjust their postures to the rise of China as a regional and global power. Students will develop connections with individuals and institutions in private and public sectors in three countries. This course will utilise the world leading expertise of the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre to provide students with discipline specific experience as part of their training to become the next generation of strategic experts in Australia.",

This course examines the immense promise and potential strategic pitfalls that confront Australia at the dawn of the so-called Asian century. Questions to be examined in this course include: might Australia be forced to make a choice between its leading trading partner China and its closest security ally the United States if and when strategic competition deepens between these two regional heavyweights? What alternative security arrangements might Australia seek as the relative strategic weight of its American ally declines in the face of Asia's rise? How might Australia compensate for the fact that it might no longer be able to maintain a clear military technological edge over many of its increasingly prosperous Southeast Asian neighbours? And will Australia be forced to cede ground in its own South Pacific sphere of influence as Asia's great powers become increasingly interested and engaged in this part of the world?",

Students will thus explore ideas about the conduct of war on the sea, on the ground, and in the air, as well as the rapidly emerging operational domains of space and cyberspace, and efforts to produce joint theories of warfare that unite activity in all these spheres.

From the war of decolonisation against the French to the US intervention from the early 1960s, Vietnam became one of the Cold War\u2019s \u2018hot wars\u2019 and a symbol of the American desire to \u2018contain\u2019 communism. Yet the communist victory in 1975 did not mean the end of war in mainland Southeast Asia. The Vietnam War\u2019s linked conflicts in Cambodia and Laos who had their own causes and consequences and the emergence of a unified Vietnam as a regional power meant it was soon embroiled in an invasion of Kampuchea and then border clashes with China. This course seeks to understanding the impact of the Vietnam wars by exploring issues around their relationship to the nature and character of war, decolonisation and imperialism, the geo-politics of Asia, the Cold War, US policies of containment, military strategy and the popular memory/interpretation of war in literature and film.",
