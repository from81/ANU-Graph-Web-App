# ANU Programs & Courses Graph Explorer

This is a React based web app with 2 features:

1. Plan / Visualize a degree
  - Given a specific degree, visualize all the requirements and courses.
  - Letâ€™s you check if there are any classes that satisfy more than one requirements.
  - Display all the classes that a student may take while taking the chosen program.
  - User can click on checkboxes in the table of classes, and the graph will update to reflect the classes taken and how much progress was made.

2. Explore courses at ANU
  - The above features are enabled by the dataset generated by running a scraper  with a custom parser that makes use of POS tagging and dependency parsing. The scraper source code can be found [here](https://github.com/kaihirota/ANU-Programs-and-Courses-Scraper)
